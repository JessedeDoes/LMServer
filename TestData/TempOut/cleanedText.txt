Extortion in an officer is where a person in office being

will not perform such service unless such a fee be given him

The value of a new service occur ing in an old office is to be 
estimated from its similarity to the old services .↵ As the fee 
which is annext to that one of the old services which comes nearest 
to the new one is to the service it belongs to ,↵ so let the fee for the 
new service be to such new services .↵ 
To p .↵ 
The Fees for offices and all services incident to these offices 
ought every where to be adjusted by the legislator .↵ Where this 
is not done the extortion is not more to be imputed to the ra= 
=pacity of the officer than to the negligence of the Legislator .↵ 
In as far as a Legislator authorizes an officer to take 
more money for his service than it is worth ,↵ or makes more 
such services necessary ↳( to the validity of a transaction )↵ than 
the end requires he lays on a Tax .↵

Servants Law 
A servant ought to behave with the same humility

his duty to his master .↵ 
If a menial servant or day labourer behave in an 
affrontive manner to a gentleman the gentleman 
may give him moderate chastisement on the spot 
and such chastisement shall not justify the servant for 
assaulting the gentleman in return if he can save himself by 
flight ;↵ unless it be to save himself from receiving irreparable 
damage 
Reasons 
A servant has been trained up in the habit of subm= 
=ission and obedience ↳( they are among the necessary duties 
of his calling .)↵ A gentleman is that of independence .↵

affront even from one of his own rank than it is to a gentleman

stand 
however does not perfectly and necessarily upon a par with 
that of either of those crimes .↵ 
First with regard to Seduction .↵ The disgrace brought upon 
the Woman by Polygamy is not so great as that which is brought 
upon her by Seduction .↵ Her chastity remains unstained .↵ She 
has been unfortunate but not culpable .↵ She has parted indeed

on the footing of a Widow .↵ In point of reason she ought not to 
be regarded in a light in the least degree less favourable .↵ 
But popular prejudice is seldom perfectly equitable to 
misfortune .↵ 
Next with regard to Sharping .↵ It is not always that 
a Woman thus imposed upon suffers in her fortune .↵ Perhaps 
she had none :↵ the only bait that tempted the Offender was her 
person .↵ It is only in case of her having had a fortune ,↵ and 
that fortune's having been dissipated by the Offender ,↵ that she 
is a sufferer in this way .↵ In the account of dissipation ,↵ so

C 
Of Semi-public Offences in General .↵ 
We come now to the second class of offences :↵ consisting 
of such as are of a semi public nature :↵ and in the first place 
to offences through calamity .↵ 
Semi-public Offences ,↵ or Offences against a class of persons may 
be distinguished in the first place into offences against a local class of 
persons ,↵ or ,↵ in other words ,↵ into offences against a Neighborhood ,↵ and 
Offences against an ideal class of persons ,↵ or in other words offences a= 
=gainst a class of persons at large .↵ By the former I mean all such 
offences which a multitude of persons are exposed to suffer on account 
of the proximity of the divisions of space which they happen res= 
↳: pectively to occupy for the time being :↵ that proximity being a 
circumstance which denominates them neighbours to each other 
and the whole tract of ground they occupy ,↵ the Neighbourhood .↵ By 
the latter I mean all offences which any such multitude of persons 
are exposed to suffer by ,↵ as happen to be connected and brought 
into the same predicament by any other circumstance .↵ 
Offences against a Neighbourhood may be distinguished in the 
first place into such as are first rate crimes and such as are only offenc= 
=es of an inferior rank .↵ Under the former division I comprehend 
the two Offences for which language has found names to wit Incen= 
=diarism and Inundation .↵ These will be treated of in form ,↵ each 
under a title by itself .↵ They are in fact but so many particular 
destruction to 
species of criminal destruction ↳: an Offence ,↵ of which as well the pro= 
↳: perty of assignable individuals as that of a Neighbourhood may 
become

to the fund ,↵ by which the common property of the Neighbourhood 
is upheld :↵ the district by which the road ,↵ the bridge ,↵ the aqueduct ,↵ the 
church ,↵ ↳( or whatever it be )↵ is kept in repair :↵ so much as regards the 
consequential damage will commonly fall principally to the share 
of Individuals :↵ of such Individuals to wit who happens to have 
sustained a special damage by reason of the mischief done to that 
article of common property which is in question .↵ The distinction 
between ordinary articles and such as are irreplaceable is of more 
particular use here than with regard to such articles as are the pro= 
↳: perty of an individual .↵ The impractibility of replacing the arti= 
↳: cle is more apt indeed in this case to regard the time than the 
thing itself .↵ A bridge ,↵ a road ,↵ a ferry-boat ,↵ an aqueduct can 
always be replaced or repaired at the long run ;↵ though it may 
require a considerable length of time to accomplish that effect :↵ 
during which interval a great deal of consequential damage may 
have been incurred .↵ In some cases however the thing may chance 
to be absolutely irreplaceable :↵ particularly when it happens to be 
some rare and ornamental work of Art .↵ Who for instance could 
make sure of finding a second Falconet to replace the statue of 
Peter the Great at Petersburgh ?↵ Or a second Pigal to replace 
that of Louis the 15th at Paris ?↵

Of the calamities which a Neighbourhood may be exposed to ,↵ the 
principal ones seem to be such as are derived from the sources follow=

↳1↵ .↵ Pestilence or Contagion .↵ 
↳2↵ .↵ Famine and other kinds of Scarcity .↵ 
↳3↵ .↵ Mischief by Infants ,↵ Idiots and Maniacs .↵ 
↳4↵ .↵ Ravages of noxious Animals .↵ 
↳5↵ .↵ Collapsion ,↵ i.e .↵ the fall of Buildings or other large masses of

↳7↵ .↵ Tempest .↵ 
↳8↵ .↵ Blight 
↳9↵ .↵ Conflagration .↵

In classing these calamities the division of crimes will not be of 
any great use .↵ It is obvious that they can none of them have any ef= 
=fect on the reputation of any individual :↵ nor yet upon his condition ,↵

any otherwise than by the physical mischief they may bring on u=

or at the least the effects of them diminished by human ingenuity 
and prudence .↵ To take the measures necessary for this purpose 
requires the political power as well as Scientific contrivance of 
the Sovereign or those who act under his authority .↵ It requires 
certain ↳[ + ]↵ 
a system of political regulations to be made which will of 
course be different ,↵ according to the different calamities which 
they are calculated to obviate .↵ Till these regulations are 
made ,↵ it will in most cases be difficult to say what par= 
↳: ticular acts have any particular tendency to promote 
any given article in the list of those calamities .↵ Such of -↵ 
↳- fences will most of them be in that case in which the motive 
for punishing exists not before the law is made .↵ The law must 
be made before the acts which it prohibits can be seen clearly 
to be of pernicious tendency .↵ As in these cases it will be impos= 
↳: sible to ascertain the description of the Offence until the regula -↵ 
↳: tions be given which it tends to counteract ,↵ those regulations 
must be given before the mischievousness of the Offence can be 
estimated and the punishment of it determined .↵ But these 
regulations are altogether dependent upon local considerations .↵ 
It is evident therefore that no place can be allotted to them 
here .↵

↳: fence against the Class as such ,↵ but so many Offences against so many

members of any corporation ,↵ or sect ,↵ or political state should be defamed

↳: fession or trade indiscriminately be prejudiced in their professional 
or commercial capacity ;↵ for instance by any such practices of a per= 
↳: son of the same profession or trade as are calculated to give him an 
unfair advantage over his fellows .↵ 
In these cases the immediate object of the offence is the class 
itself :↵ but the special damage ,↵ if there is any ,↵ falls upon individu= 
↳: als .↵ Where there is no special damage therefore ,↵ the Offender can only be 
punished criminally in behalf of the class at large :↵ where there is spe= 
=cial damage he may be punished civilly as well as criminally 
in behalf as well of the class as of the particular individuals damnifi=

Now when the marketable price of the thing

it may be very well worth his while to pay 
a guinea for the pleasure of exposing You to

he means to keep it ,↵ as an additional mo=

With mercantile Frauds the Case is different .↵ Of the 
persons concerned in those Offences some ,↵ indeed a great 
number ,↵ probably the greater number ,↵ will be persons poss :↵ 
↳: essed of a very small degree of responsibility :↵ but a consi :↵ 
↳: derable number will also be perfectly responsible :↵ for against 
the temptation of fraud no rank of Traders is absolutely 
proof :↵ and in the class of Traders are included persons of 
all degrees of responsibility from the very lowest to the 
very highest .↵ On this account it seems improper to subject 
offenders of the highest rank ,↵ at all events ,↵ to such a degree 
of punishment ,↵ as those only of the lowest stand in need of .↵ 
At the same time in mercantile frauds the improbity 
of intention is apt perhaps to be not quite so palpable as 
in theft ;↵ and what perhaps is more to the purpose the 
rank and figure and reputation of the persons who are 
sometimes betrayed into offences of this kind serve in 
some degree to mitigate the natural infamy .↵ It might on 
this account seem harsh and unpopular to subject them at 
all events to the same degree of factitious legal infamy .↵

Introductory Observations .↵ 
In the mention of Frauds relative to the Coin the 
act 
Act of Coining naturally takes the lead :↵ but it is the uttering 
bad 
of base Coin ,↵ the obtaining things of a certain Value in return 
for a thing pretended to be of equal but which in fact is of 
less Value ,↵ that produces all the Mischief .↵ 
Coining is a species of Forgery .↵ The impression given 
to a piece of coin is designed to answer the purpose of a dis= 
↳: course to this effect ;↵ ↳" I the Officer in this case appointed by 
↳" the Law ,↵ do certify ,↵ that the substance which you here see con= 
↳: tains such or such a quantity or quantities of such or such 
↳" a metal or metals ."↵ Now in every state there are but one or 
more particular set or sets of Officers appointed for this pur= 
↳: pose .↵ If then any person who is not of any such set takes 
upon him to fashion any portion of matter in the view of 
causing it to be taken for a portion of matter so stamped 
and by such authority ,↵ or alters the quantity or quantities of 
any 
↳1 0↵ 
C 
Frauds relative to the Coin .↵ 
portion of matter on which such stamp has been put by such 
authority ,↵ if ,↵ in a word ,↵ he either applies to any such piece a do= 
↳: cument + purporting to have been executed by a person by whom it 
was not executed ,↵ or alters a document which has been executed by 
the proper person ,↵ he commits in either case ,↵ a particular kind 
of Forgery .↵ The profit arises from the difference in point of 
value ,↵ between the counterfeit or diminished Coin ,↵ and the 
genuine or entire ,↵ for which it is intended to be passed .↵ 
This offence has commonly been stiled Treason ,↵ and ,↵ 
in many respects ,↵ treated as if it were so .↵ But with as much 
propriety it might have been called by any other odious 
name .↵ It is not committed with the views ,↵ nor has it any of the 
effects ,↵ of Treason .↵ When a man coins false money it is not 
to usurp power ,↵ but property .↵ It is not like Treason the Crime 
of the Courtier or of the Soldier or of the Lawyer :↵ but of the Ar=

Instructions to the Legislator .↵ 
The auxiliary expedients that may be employed 
in aid of that which consists simply in the application of Punish= 
↳: ment to the very offence which is intrinsically obnoxious seem 
reducible to the following heads :↵ viz 
↳1↵ .↵ Provisions against preliminary offences ;↵ or Provisions 
of which the object is to search out and punish as many as 
possible of the acts which may be necessary to be performed 
before the process of Coining can be accomplished .↵

general

general idea .↵ 
↳1↵ .↵ If among the instruments necessary for making Coin 
in a particular manner there be any which are not necessa= 
=ry for the purpose of any other Art ↳, the use and possession 
of all such instruments may be prohibited ↳( giving proper no=

↳: cation .↵ 
↳2↵ .↵ If there be any instruments necessary for the making of 
the above mentioned instruments and which are not necessary for 
any other Art ,↵ such instruments may be prohibited in like 
so on :↵ 
manner and soon ↳: and in short the more operations could be in= 
↳: troduced into the process so as to be necessary to the giving the 
Coin its distinctive properties and the more unlike those ope= 
↳: rations were to one another ,↵ the better .↵ 
trifling utility 
↳3↵ .↵ If such other Art be of trivial use it might be worth while 
to make a sacrifice of it to the security of the Coinage and to 
prohibit it altogether .↵ 
↳4↵ .↵ If it should be of too much use to be sacrificed still the exer=

exercise of it might be laid under certain restrictions ↳. For in= 
↳: stance no man might be allowed to use the instument in 
question without a licence :↵ nor should any man who was al= 
it 
↳: lowed to use be allowed to keep it by him at all times ↳; it 
might be kept under several keys of which an officer ,↵ to 
be appointed for the purpose ↳, should have one ↳, so as not to 
be sued but in his presence .↵ 
As to the mere Act of Coining considered by itself 
the chance of convicting a man of it upon direct proof is compa= 
↳: ratively very slender ↳; such proof unless by some very ex= 
↳: traordinary accident is never to be had but from the testi= 
↳: mony of some of the confederates .↵ This is owing to the par= 
↳: ticular nature of the act which ,↵ however mischievous it 
may be in its design and consequences ,↵ yet not being the

for the first offence Six Months imprisonment ;↵ for the Second

This statute ,↵ as any one may imagine ,↵ is not executed .↵ 
If it were there are few persons in the nation who might not

With regard to the Copper Coin every body knows that 
it is not all uncommon for counterfeit halfpence to be passed 
off ,↵ not only knowingly but avowedly ;↵ since it is not at all 
uncommon for people even knowingly to accept them .↵ When 
this is the case it is generally owing to the indifference with 
which the matter is regarded on both sides ,↵ on account of the 
triflingness of the sum and the assurance which the accept= 
↳: or has of being able to pass off the money to some other per

Reasons .↵ 
↳1↵ .↵ The mischief in the two Cases is either just 
the 
Note .↵ 
Coin :↵ and in this latter case the circulation of the base money is a 
good deal aided by the difficulty or rather impossibility of meeting 
any where with a sufficient quantity of genuine .↵ 
In both these instances indeed ,↵ it may be said that gener= 
↳: ally speaking there is no knowledge in the case ;↵ that there is 
nothing more than bare suspicion .↵ There is however very fre= 
=quently a persuasion ;↵ and that as entire as any which the Evi= 
=dence of a man's senses can produce .↵ If then all that the term 
knowledge imports is that the matter of fact is true ,↵ or that 
the party who is said to know it is persuaded of its being so ,↵ 
there is often as much knowledge in this case as there can be 
in any .↵ If the meaning was that the circumstance of know= 
↳: ledge should be taken for granted unless the contrary be 
proved by some additional collateral evidence it were worth 
while surely to have said so .↵ To denounce a punishment 
when there is evidently no chance of its being executed can 
serve only to bring the Law into contempt .↵

it to be counterfeit ,↵ it will be impossible to prove as much by 
any external evidence ;↵ if then external evidence is required ,↵ the 
facility of evading the Law will be such as to strip it of all 
its efficacy :↵ if no external evidence is required ,↵ but the know= 
↳: ledge is left to be inferred and that conclusively from the mere 
appearance of the piece of money ,↵ it is exposing a Man to suf=

he may not have done any thing amiss at all ↳; and in the o= 
↳: ther ,↵ no more than what almost any man might do with=

This is enough to stand effectually in the way of any 
punishment that can be employed against an Offence so circum=

Quest :↵ IV .↵ Why fraudulently uttering without 
Confederacy is not punished as Coining ,↵ 
Reasons .↵ 
Note .↵ 
there is in England ;↵ and on the other hand there is much less 
Gold .↵ In England there is a vast quantity of Paper-money in cir= 
↳: culation which is altogether upon a par with Coin ;↵ a phe= 
↳: nomenon which is fearcely visible in other Countries .↵ In 
France whether owing to the severity of the punishment ,↵ or

employ for the discovery of offenders ,↵ bad money is compa= 
↳: ratively but rare .↵ In England at present there is now 
and then a little bad Gold ,↵ there is a great deal of bad 
copper ,↵ and there is scarce any but bad Silver ;↵ the govern=

only be practised upon a chance opportunity for the sake of 
a small and transient Profit .↵ 
In this respect ,↵ this offence stands upon nearly the footing 
with that of Cheating by false Weights and Measures :↵ with this 
difference that the Offender is not likely to be so responsible in 
the former Case as in the latter .↵ The Stock and Substance 
of the Tradesman who sells the produce of the labour of a mul= 
↳: titude of workmen ,↵ is in general much greater ,↵ than that of the 
workman whose dealings are confined to the produce of his 
own .↵ 
Robbery being an Offence against Property and Person both 
is a much more mischievous offence than Theft or any Fraud upon 
Property or ,↵ in short ,↵ than any offence against Person and Property 
alone .↵ It would therefore be a very mischievous measure to turn 
a Thief into a Robber .↵ Such would be the case if the Punish= 
↳: ment for Theft were severer than that of Robbery .↵ For these 
are Crimes that are apt constantly to come in competition ;↵ crimes 
to the temptation of which the same person is apt to be exposed .↵ 
A Thief or a Sharper who has followed his occupation for a length 
of

and honest Industry ,↵ if he ever had any ,↵ are obliterated ;↵ his 
reputation ,↵ if he ever had any ,↵ is gone .↵ Frighten him from 
practising Theft ,↵ he will have nothing left for it but to 
turn Robber .↵ 
Between Coining and Robbery the case is different .↵ A 
man's being in the habit of Coining may in general be looked 
upon as a presumption of his possessing some honest Art from 
which this illicit practise is only an occasional deviation ,↵ and 
to which if forced back by salutary terrors ,↵ he may at any 
time return .↵ A button maker or silversmith who has taken 
to Coining ,↵ although he should cease to coin ,↵ may continue 
to subsist :↵ he has only to confine himself to the proper bu= 
↳: siness of a silversmith or a button maker .↵ On such a per=

Quest .↵ VI .↵ 
↳5 8↵ 
C 
Of Frauds relative to the Coin .↵ 
Quest .↵ VI .↵ Why the Punishment is no severer ?↵ 
Reasons 
The mischief that can be done in this way by one offend= 
↳: er or even a confederacy of offenders is not so great as at first sight 
it might appear .↵ By himself a man of a given rank of life for= 
↳: tune and occupation cannot ,↵ without being detected ,↵ circulate 
more Coin that it will be expected should be disbursed by a 
as his appears to be 
man of such rank ,↵ fortune ,↵ and reputation ↳: and ,↵ of the Coin which 
he does circulate ,↵ certainly it is not the whole that can be bad 
Coin of his own coining .↵ What he can circulate of this bad 
Coin without being detected ,↵ will even bear but a small 
ratio to the whole of the coin he circulates .↵ It is true ,↵ that 
by continually changing the people with whom he deals ,↵ and 
thus contriving always to have strangers to deal with ,↵ he may 
circulate more and more :↵ but the circulation even when this 
method is taken to extend it ,↵ has still its bounds .↵ In the 
first place the being perpetually employed in finding out new 
persons to deal with will take up a considerable degree 
of time .↵ In the next place he must ,↵ upon an average ,↵ expend 
with 
↳5 9↵ 
C 
Of Frauds relative to the Coin 
with each of those persons a greater quantity of good Coin in 
order to cover a smaller quantity of his own bad Coin .↵ 
The time which it will necessarily take him up 
to find fit persons to deal with will be so much time taken 
from his lawful occupation :↵ nor can a man carry on the frau= 
↳: dulent occupation in question without such a kind of ingenuity 
derived from some lawful occupation he has been tieed up 
in ,↵ as will naturally expose him in some degree to suspi= 
↳: cion .↵ If a manufacturer of metal buttons for instance gives 
three or four shillings or three or four half pence in change 
together that appear to be of the same die this circumstance 
may of itself be sufficient to fix a considerable degree of 
suspicion on a person of such an occupation .↵ He can sel= 
↳: dom therefore venture to put off many such pieces together .↵ 
If he procures many different moulds or stamps this will 
in proportion take up more expence and time .↵ Bad money 
is in general more liable to suspicion the fresher it is ;↵ for 
the fresher they both are ,↵ the more easy it is to discover 
those minute differences by which bad Coin is distinguishable 
from 
↳6 0↵ 
C 
Of Frauds relative to the Coin .↵ 
from good .↵ By wearing ,↵ those differences are partly obliterat= 
↳: ed and partly covered over with dirt :↵ if then he takes 
the precaution to wear his Money ,↵ this precaution ,↵ when ex= 
↳: tended to any considerable quantity ↳, will give him a con= 
↳: siderable degree of trouble ,↵ and take up a considerable de= 
↳: gree of time ,↵ and mean time expose him to a considerable 
degree of danger .↵ For ,↵ if the being seen to have two or three 
pieces at once of bad Coin of the same appearance will 
expose his character to some suspicion ,↵ the being seen with 
two or three hundred pieces of such Coin will most proba= 
↳: bly betray him altogether .↵ 
By engaging Associates and carrying on the busi= 
↳: ness in partnership ,↵ he may ,↵ it is true ,↵ very much in= 
↳: crease his profit ;↵ but then what he gets in point of se= 
↳: curity by these means in one way he loses in another .↵ 
He can with more security practise his plan of impositi= 
↳: on upon strangers :↵ but then he is exposed to continual 
discovery in the part of his confederates :↵ who must in a 
great

great degree have parted with their integrity before they could 
have become so .↵ 
↳2↵ .↵ Another circumstance that contributes in a con= 
↳: siderable degree to lessen the mischief of this offence 
is its tendency to distribute itself into small parcels and 
amongst different individuals ,↵ by which means it is much 
less felt upon the whole than if it rested altogether in 
one undivided Mass .↵ By Theft or false pretences or 
Robbery a Man may get all the money You have ;↵ it 
is what happens every day :↵ but it will be strange if ,↵ 
in exchange for all the money You have or for an equi= 
↳: valent quantity of any other kind of property ,↵ he can 
prevail on You to be paid altogether in bad Coin .↵ Sup= 
↳: pose even this to happen You will in time be able 
to put off if not the whole yet more or less of it ,↵ u= 
↳: pon other people :↵ for ,↵ singular indeed must have been 
your inattention if the whole of it together could pass 
upon You and You could not find a single person else

thing ,↵ each man stands ensured by his neighbours a= 
↳: gainst any capital Loss that might otherwise befal

One branch of the secondary mischief ,↵ the pain of appre= 
=hension seems to be rather less in this case than even in that 
of ordinary sharping for the same reason that in that case 
it is less than in the case of Theft .↵ The apprehension a 
man feels at knowing of another who has lost to the value 
of a Guinea for example ,↵ in this way ,↵ seems not in general 
to be so great as the apprehension a man feels at knowing 
of another who has lost to the same value by an act of sharp=

precaution ,↵ so as he does but think it worth his while ,↵ 
every man in a manner must feel ,↵ that ,↵ if he pleases ,↵ it 
is in his power to guard himself effectually against suf= 
↳: fering by bad money .↵ The case is that people in gene= 
↳: ral choose rather to run something of a hazard ,↵ than 
to put themselves to such a degree of trouble in examin= 
↳: ing the money they receive ,↵ as is necessary to secure them 
effectually against deception .↵ The more however ,↵ a man 
would be affected by the loss ,↵ the more trouble he is at in

worth his while to examine it with ever so little attention :↵ so that the

C 
Of Frauds relative to the Coin .↵ 
Quest VII .↵ Why the Punishment in this Case may 
be fixed ,↵ 
Reason 
Because the mischief is to be estimated in this Case 
not from the particular consequences of any single Act ,↵ but from 
the general consequences of the obnoxious habit .↵ See Quest V .↵ 
It can answer therefore no purpose to make the pu= 
↳: nishment rise and fall with the profit upon any single 
offence .↵ The profit which the punishment must be made 
to outweigh is the profit not upon the particular Act ,↵ but 
upon the habitual Practice .↵ Now the quantum of the for= 
↳: mer is susceptible of direct proof .↵ But this is not the case 
with the latter .↵ It can be appraised no otherwise than by a 
random calculation .↵ This calculation may be the same for 
all cases .↵ It may therefore as well be made by the Legis=

fall .↵ He knows perhaps the person on whom it has pass= 
↳: ed off the bad money ;↵ but he knows not ↳( since it is what 
in general nobody can know ),↵ whether the least part of it 
will ultimately rest upon that person .↵ In this respect it stands 
in some measure upon a footing with smuggling and other Of -↵ 
↳: fences against the Revenue :↵ offences which are never so unpo= 
↳: pular as it is to be wished they were .↵ It does not ,↵ it is true ,↵ 
stand altogether upon so good a footing :↵ since the distress 
produced by the offence is not so perfectly out of sight in 
the former case as in the latter .↵ Still however it is much 
more out of sight than in the Cases of Theft and Sharping :↵ 
and is therefore likely to be looked upon with more indul= 
↳: gence .↵ 
↳2↵ .↵ Because it is not likely in this case as in others to de= 
↳: prive him of his livelyhood .↵ If a man was to be pointed out 
wherever he went as a Sharper or a Thief ,↵ people would conclude 
that 
↳6 7↵ 
C 
Of Frauds relative to the Coin .↵ 
that he was never to be trusted ;↵ that he had put off his habits 
of industry ,↵ if he ever had any ,↵ and lost his talents for want of 
exercise ;↵ and in a word that he was become totally irresponsible .↵ 
With a Coiner the case is very different .↵ The very talent which 
fits a man for practising this ingenious though dishonest spe= 
↳: cies of industry is a kind of fund of responsibility of which 
the very punishment that marks his crime will certify 
him to be in possession .↵ It will at the same time be a 
pledge of his future good behaviour with respect to offences 
of mere indigence :↵ since while he possesses it he is enabled 
commonly to make such a profit at ↳1↵ a place where he is 
settled as he could not readily be sure of making at any o= 
↳: ther .↵ A man who can do nothing for example but dig ,↵ 
may get at one place as well as at another such low 
wages as are to be got for digging :↵ but a man who under= 
↳: stands silver chasing for instance or engraving can get the 
extraordinary wages that are given for such ingenious 
work at no other than the few places at which such work 
gave way ↳, 
is to be done .↵ He yielded ,↵ it will be said ,↵ to a great tempta= 
tion ,↵

temptation ,↵ it is true ;↵ to the temptation of making a large 
fortune apparently at a rapid rate .↵ He might nevertheless 
stand firm against a small temptation :↵ against the greatest 
temptation which could be afforded him by the greatest 
quantity of stock it would be necessary to trust him with 
for the purpose of his carrying on any of those honest oc=

Defamation ,↵ it is true ,↵ is rather more likely to pro=

accompanied by reproach :↵ and this produces at any rate 
a present pain .↵ But then on the other hand this is all 
the mischief it is likely to produce .↵ A man in this 
case has the Opportunity of defending his Reputation 
the instant it is in danger .↵ It is not absolutely certain 
indeed that his defence even in this case will be suc= 
↳: cessful ;↵ it is not certain that he will be able to clear 
himself of the imputation :↵ it is however most probable :↵ 
since by the supposition he defends himself with all 
the advantage which truth has over falsehood .↵ When 
the imputation is cast upon him behind his back he has 
not this advantage ,↵ at the time :↵ perhaps he may never

about the manner in which it should be punished .↵ It is 
an offence against one's own state ,↵ as such it ought to be 
punished in the same manner as an offence of the same 
kind committed against a native .↵ While the foreigner conti= 
↳: nues in the dominions of one's own state ,↵ and as such 
remains contributory to its well-being and subject to its 
authority it has the same reason nearly for affording 
protection to him as to a native .↵ In this point of view 
it is as much affected by the primary mischief of the in=

affected by the secondary mischief as if he were a native .↵ 
to 
It will of course therefore give him the same degree of 
protection as to a native ;↵ and unless in the particular

Offences against the external Security of the State .↵ 
Now let us consider the case where the party in :↵ 
↳: jured is a privileged member of a state in amity .↵ For 
the sake of the intercourse carried on between one state 
and another when at amity it has been the custom to 
invest those by whose means it is carried on ,↵ with par= 
↳: ticular distinctions .↵ Such persons are known by diffe= 
↳: rent names according to their different ranks :↵ but they 
are also known all together by the common appellation 
of Foreign Ministers .↵ Were a person permitted to do an 
injury to these great officers at no higher a price than 
it would cost him to do the like injury to an ordinary 
person ,↵ it is evident enough that on various occasions 
the interests of both states might suffer in a very high 
degree by the interruption which such outrages might 
occasion in the management of their concerns .↵ Even 
in cases where no material interruption might ensue 
to such concerns ,↵ the pride as well of sovereigns whose 
persons these Officers are understood in a manner to

constitutes perhaps the most immediate and universal 
reason for giving an extraordinary degree of protection 
to these privileged foreigners against all injuries what=

To appease that resentment ↳, an obvious expedient 
is to deliver up to the Sovereign of the injured State all 
have been 
persons whatsoever who were concerned in the injury of=

scarcely fail of being effectual in any case ↳; and though 
in most cases it may not be necessary ↳, yet as there 
may be cases in which nothing less will serve ,↵ it is fit 
that a power should be given to the judicial Magistrate 
to put it in practice if ever the Security of the State 
should call for such a sacrifice .↵ 
The same power should for the like reasons be reserv=

the gain to be made by such a traffic is a motive that is more

it may be proper to give to such acts will depend altogether

Of Idleness 
With regard to his own property a man may offend ,↵

↳: ting to get by industrious means what is necessary 
for his support when he has none .↵ This goes by the 
name of Idleness .↵ 
The mischief of idleness is the tendency 
which it has to give birth to all the crimes of indi :↵

Idleness then ,↵ when the result of choice and ac :↵

This is not the case with idleness :↵ since for a man to 
have employment ,↵ two parties must concur :↵ himself 
to accept it ,↵ and somebody else to give it him .↵ It is 
plain therefore that the Legislator before he can ,↵ with

If a man pawns the goods of another as if they were his 
own this is one way of converting them to his own use 
Observation,s 
It may be thought that pawning another persons ↳_ 
goods is not quite so mischievous an offence as ordinary 
stealing And in truth the mischievous consequence of an 
act of Theft is in some small degree deminished by the goods 
being disposed of in this manner .↵ If a man pawns the 
goods instead of selling them out right it affords some 
presumption of his intending to restore them :↵ besides 
that by being deposited with the pawnbroker they are 
responsible 
forthcoming in the hands of a respectable person and all 
there is wanting is it ,↵ being discovered where they are 
which by the attention and honesty of the pawn brokers 
is what very often happens 
But if the offender does really return the goods provi=

of his punishment ↳: and as it is strictly and indubitably

Other Offences operating on the same Subject ,↵ viz :↵

Simple however as this is in the Mode ↳& Principle 
of its Perpetration there is no Offence that has in many 
Cases the Conception of it's distinctive Characters more 
intricate ,↵ nor therefore the Doctrine relative to it more 
complicated :↵ owing partly to what Intricacy of it's natural 
Character ,↵ and partly to it's having been made by our 
own Laws especially to take a different factitious one 
from every one of a great Variety of Modifications ↳& 
Relations ,↵ as will be hereafter explained ,↵ of which that

some are this very Offence with Addition ,↵ others can 
not be compleatly characterised but by their 
Distinctions from this Offence ,↵ it is this before all 
such that calls for our Review .↵ 
In treating of this Title the following is the 
Order which I shall pursue 
1st .↵ I shall establish a Definition of the Crime .↵ 
2nd I shall exhibit the several exemptive Distinctions ,↵ 
that have been taken out of this Definition by 
the positive Establishment of our Common Law ,↵ to 
which I shall give the Title of Anomalities 
restrictive .↵ 
3dly .↵ The various correctives that have been 
administer'd to them respectively by the Hand of 
Legislature .↵ These I shall call Corrections 
to those Anomalities .↵

as ,↵ having passed the limits of the Characteristic 
Punishment ,↵ have established Distinctions

THEFT .↵ 
comparative 
5.thly ↳& lastly .↵ I shall undertake the relative 
Estimation of the several particular Offences into 
which both Kinds of Distinctions have broken 
the general Title .↵ 
Before we proceed further ,↵ the employing of 
a few Words in fixing an Article of Nomenclature 
will be by no Means an useless Digression :↵ in 
Order if possible to establish that Distinctness of 
Conception which is very necessary to a commanding 
Knowledge of the Subject ,↵ but which practical 
Writers have appeared little sollicitous to transmit 
or to acquire .↵ 
There are two Terms employed and that often 
promiscuously in speaking of the Offence in Question 
↳_ The one more popular in it's Use and ample in 
it's Signification ↳_ Theft ↳_ The other more technical 
in it's Use and confined in it's Signification ↳_ Larceny .↵ 
The Verb ↳" to steal "↵ with it's Participle ↳" stealing "↵ 
is exactly parallel in it's Use and commensurate in 
it's Signification with the former of these ,↵ being the 
same

THEFT .↵ 
same Idea in Substance ,↵ only as if it were under a 
different grammatical Modification ↳_ the two first 
being used where a Verb or a Participle ,↵ the latter 
where a Substantive is required .↵ 
The Use of the Word Theft is governed by the 
Nature of the Act ;↵ and ↳' tis from thence as we gap/ shall 
soon see that it takes it's Definition .↵ 
The Word Larceny has its Import coextensive only 
the 
with Punishment annexed by the peculiar Jurisprudence 
of our own Country to the main Body of the other 
Title :↵ applying in it's proper Signification to such 
Cases only of Theft as are punished with the Punishment 
called Felony .↵ 
With Regard to this Definition ,↵ the Source of 
which will be hereafter explained ,↵ it is sufficient at 
present to observe ,↵ that it is not taken from any Difference 
in the Nature of the Act :↵ so that if when therefore we 
meet with any Passage in a practical Book which intimates 
↳, that of such ↳& such a Subject Larceny cannot be committed ,↵ 
it 
we are not to conceive that the Act of Stealing is deficient 
in any of those Qualities which if it had been committed 
on certain other Subjects would have denominated it 
Larceny 
↳2 2↵ 
THEFT 
The Definition I am about to give ,↵ indicative of 
the Nature of the Act ,↵ is commensurate to the Term ,↵ 
expressive of the moral Idea ,↵ Theft .↵ 
DEFINITION 
Theft then may be defined ,↵ The taking of a 
moveable thing ,↵ by one conscious of his not having 
any Title so to do ,↵ and without the Consent of any 
one who has ,↵ in the Intention of making it his own .↵ 
Distinguishable from this in it's Conception ,↵ though 
actually distinguished from it by the Law ,↵ in some 
Instances only ,↵ whilst in others it is confounded with 
it ,↵ is the Offence of Embezzlement .↵ 
Embezzlement is where a Man having 
taken ,↵ on having Liberty to take a moveable Thing ,↵ by 
the Consent of the Owner expressed or to be implied ,↵ 
if not obtained by Fraud ,↵ does some Act with the 
Intention of making it his own in the consciousness of 
having no Title so to do .↵ 
Having for a Moment introduced the Mention of 
this Offence here ,↵ for the sake of narrowing the Notion of 
Theft on all sides to it's proper Point ,↵ I shall dismiss the 
further 
↳2 6↵ 
THEFT 
Further consideration of it to a subsequent chapter 
appropriated to that title .↵ 
To return therefore to 
Theft 
And first as to the taking It may be 
a Question ,↵ by whom is it to be determined ,↵ in every 
again 
Case ,↵ whether this has or has not happened ?↵ and secondly 
whether by their own naked Discretion pro re nata or 
with any preestablished Rules for their Assistance ?↵ 
to the first 
I answer by no means by the judge .↵ lest least we 
should have a taking which no common Man 
would deem such ,↵ as we have already a Breaking 
where nothing is broken and an Entry where nobody 
has got in 
involves 
Thise point here to be decided involves no collateral 
Point of Law ,↵ the Question being merely whether that 
which a common Man would deem a taking has 
been done ?↵ 
The misfortune is that with regard to this ,↵ there 
will be differences of opinion :↵ but either their Differences 
are reconcileable by Rules intelligible to those about

which 
from the Necessity of giving some Name for an Idea 
I have frequent Occasion to recall 
+ If this Mode of Expression should be thought too 
remote from ordinary Language it might run 
thus :↵ ↳" The Action of the Taker being exerted 
directly on the Thing taken ,↵ 
|| In like Manner for the same reason instead of 
↳" Agent rational or irrational "↵ might be put 
↳" Person or Thing "↵

are not ↳_ If not ,↵ it is to no purpose to set a Judge 
to make them ;↵ especially when the Deed which 
called fpr them is over :↵ if they are ,↵ let those Rules 
be established before hand that they whose Fate is 
to depend upon them may be warned in Time .↵ 
I answer therefore 2dly by all Means by 
the Jury ;↵ to wit ,↵ either judging from the Circumstances 
of each particular Case without any more explicit 
Specification ,↵ or else with these explanatory 
Aphorisms for their Direction 
+APHORISM 1st 
Taking ↳( as to the Means )↵ may be either 1st 
direct or indirect 1st direct ;↵ the Energy of the Taker 
being exerted directly on the Subject as by taking 
up a Bag of Money+ with his own Hands 2nd or 
Indirect ;↵ by the Intervention of some other Agent 
rational or irrational|| 
Rational as by commanding a Bystander 
not in Confederacy ↳# to take it up ↳& carry it off as

Irrational 
↳# This whole Aphorism might be exprest more 
concisely ,↵ but whether with sufficient precision 
I must leave to the Reader to determine ,↵ thus ↳_ 
A taking may be by the person himself ,↵ or by 
means of some thing or person else

Irrational as by driving off by Shouts a Horse 
laden with such a Bag ,↵ or by making a Dog to 
take it up ↳& follow him ↳# 
Aphorism 2d 
Taking ↳( as to the Manner )↵ may be 
by altering the State in which the Subject + is ,↵ whether 
of 
of Motion or Rest .↵ 
Of Motion ↳_ as by cutting 
down a Bag of Money from a Carriage passing by .↵ 
Of Rest ↳_ as by drawing away 
the Bag ,↵ the Carriage standing still .↵ 
Aphorism 3d 
But in either Case ,↵ the Thing in 
Question ,↵ to have been taken ,↵ must have been so 
dealt with ,↵ as that after the taking ,↵ no part of it 
shall continue to touch any Part of any Thing which 
it touched before|| 
Aphorism 4th 
To this purpose a Heap of Things is 
to 
↳3 8↵ 
THEFT .↵ 
to be considered as one Thing 
It is for the intelligent Reader to decide whether 
Explanations pushed to this Degree of Refinement 
will or will not be of service upon the whole towards 
the solving of such Doubts as a Jury might be 
liable to entertain .↵ 
With this Idea ↳( concerning what shall ↳& 
what shall not amount to a taking )↵ coincide as 
far as they go the received Doctrines of the Law .↵ 
On the affirmative it has been holden ,↵ 
that a Man who had taken off the Sheets of a Bed ,↵ 
and carried them down into the Hall ,↵ that a Man 
who had pulled off the Skin or the Wool from a 
Sheep ,↵ that a Man who had taken Plate out of a 
Trunk and laid it at on the Floor had severally so 
acted as to consummate to this Purpose their respective 
Guilt .↵ ↳# 
These Cases are indeed adduced by the practical 
Writers as Instances of the carrying away ,↵ the Asportation 
which the Forms require to be charged as a Fact contradistinct 
from and over and above the taking :↵ tho '↵ I believe it 
would somewhat puzzle a Man using the Language of 
common 
↳# Hawkins 92.93 
↳4 2↵ 
THEFT 
common Sense ↳& not of Law to say ,↵ if this was a 
carrying away ↳& not a taking ,↵ what a taking was ;↵ and 
that such an one if asked in any of these Cases ,↵ 
Did the Thief carry 
Is the Man carrying the Goods away ?↵ would either 
be apt to say ,↵ no ;↵ take them he did ,↵ but he was 
seized before he could carry them away .↵ ||| 
On the negative side I find neither 
Decision nor Opinion .↵ 
I have drawn the Line of Consummation 
at this stage of the guilty Process ,↵ because ↳' twas at 
this that I thought it would be most gap/ conspicuous 
and least liable to Controversy .↵ If not ,↵ let there be 
supposed some Period posterior to and distinct from the 
↳" taking "↵ and let it be called the ↳" carrying away "↵ ↳# 
Now carrying away must be from some place 
by 
to some other :↵ but to settle the explanatory Aphorisms 
the Limits between these two Places in every Case that 
might occur would lead into endless Difficulties and 
Disenssions ;↵ and to leave it to the Jury in every 
Case without any such Direction would induce great 
Fluctuation of in ↳& Uncertainty in the Decisions 
when 
↳5 8↵ 
THEFT 
in all its present Minuteness :↵ is covering at once 
all those Inlets to Impunity under equal guilt ,↵ which 
an acute and interested Examination of the subsisting 
Doctrine might discover .↵ 
But here again another Question 
may occur ↳( for it has already occurred to Writers + 
in other Words )↵ whether the presence of this Consciousness 
is to be left to the Jury,(to whom I refer the Cognizance 
of it without Hesitation for the Reasons mentioned 
under the word ↳" Taking ")↵ to infer without further 
without further rule 
Rule by their Discretion ;↵ or whether any such points 
conclusively 
of Behaviour from which it may be infer'd by Law are 
capable of being number'd ↳& ascertained ?↵ 
I have taken no small pains to find an 
Answer to this Question ,↵ and the Results is that I 
conceive they are reducible to one of these ↳4↵ viz :↵ 
1st .↵ Concealment of the Act of taking 2d Conceal -↵

For Examples in Proof of this ,↵ to avoid tedious 
Details ,↵ I must be content to refer myself to the 
Reader's Imagination .↵ 
The inserting Aphorisms concerning them 
in the popular Code would have a mischievous 
Consequence ,↵ if any ;↵ in as much as it would 
serve to point out to Malefactors the precautions 
conducive to their Security .↵ 
4th Without the Consent of him who 
has ,↵ or of any acting one on his Behalf 
This is inserted for the sake of distinguishing 
the Crime in Question as well from Embezzlement 
as from the several Kinds of Frauds .↵ 
How these are respectively distinguished from 
each other will be seen in its proper place .↵ 
5th In the Intention of making it 
his own .↵ 
I believe this Expression will be deemed less 
equivocal than another which I had under Consideration ;↵ 
viz :↵ ↳" converting it to his own use "↵ which latter 
might in strictness perhaps be used of a Man 
who took away any Utensil of his Neighbour's tho '↵ 
in

that of 
If the Expression instead of ↳" making it 
his own "↵ which I have adopted ,↵ or of ↳" converting it to 
his own use "↵ which for the above Reason I have 
that 
rejected were to see of the not returning it "↵ an 
Expression which a scrutinizing Reader ↳( and such 
I wish for)might be apt to object to me as 
answering the purpose better than either ,↵ because 
adopted to fix the sense of one of them ,↵ an Inconvenience 
might ensue of which the following Supposition 
may serve for an Example 
A .↵ agrees with B .↵ to buy 
B's Plow :↵ he is to take it away in six Days ,↵ and 
pay for it in a Month _↵ C knowing of this 
Agreement takes the Plow from B's House 
without leave on the 5th Day ,↵ in the Intention 
which 
↳( we will suppose sufficiently evinced by his Conduct 
at the Time or after )↵ of keeping it two Days or 
three Days and then not returning it back to 
B .↵

tho '↵ it is probable that a Jury would hold themselves 
entitled to refuse giving such a Decision ,↵ even if 
this were the Clause adopted ,↵ as should subject a 
Man under such Circumstances to Punishment 
as for Theft ,↵ 
yet that Letter it will be admitted is certainly 
to be preferred ,↵ from which,in Pursuit of the Spirit ,↵ 
there is least likelihood to be a Necessity of disparity .↵ 
Whether in such a Case a Jury will depart or 
must always 
no ,↵ depends upon the greater or less scrupulousness 
of their Tempers :↵ if they will not ,↵ a Man plainly 
innocent is found guilty ;↵ if they will do ,↵ their 
Decision will stand as an Evidence of the Imperfection 
of a Law ,↵ thereby shewn to be of such a Nature as 
that it was not fit to be punctually observed .↵ 
When once it is admitted that Violence may

A Definition should be composed of terms that

here ,↵ it would be dangerous to say :↵ especially if what I suspect

without sense

If we look to see this rule observed by our Author ,↵ we shall be disap ↳-

Governor and his said Successors shall on the application of 
such Prisoner ↳( he being able to work )↵ engage such Prisoner

1/3 of which allowance of ↳1↵ a day may be retained by such 
payment of 
Governor for necessary cloathing furnished by him to the said 
Prisoner ,↵ untill the amount thereof not exceeding £3 
shall have been discharged .↵ 
Art.20 To bind the attention of the said Jeremy Bentham 
and his said Successors the more forcibly to the reformatory 
part of the management of the said intended Penitentiary House ,↵ 
and even make amends in most instances for any accident of its 
failure ,↵ it is moreover agreed that in the event of any such 
prisoner's committing any felony after his discharge ,↵ there shall 
be paid by the said Jeremy Bentham or his said Successors ,↵ on 
the conviction of such felon ↳, a sum of money applicable to the 
indemnification of the party or parties damnified by such felony ,↵ 
encreasing according to the number of years during which 
such felon shall have been under the care of the said intend -↵ 
↳- ed Governors :↵ to wit a sum equal in amount to the damage 
by the injury from such felony ,↵ except that the same shall 
not exceed £5 ,↵ should such felon have been one full year 
under the care of such intended Governors ;↵ £10 ,↵ if two years ;↵ 
£15 ,↵ if three years ;↵ ↳2 0↵ ,↵ if four years ;↵ £25 ,↵ if five years

been convicted of divers felonies ,↵ the sums payable on account 
thereof shall not in the whole exceed the several utmost sums

Art.21 .↵ To keep the management of the said intended 
Penitentiary Establishment the more constantly and effectually 
under the eye of Justice ,↵ it is hereby also agreed that the said first 
intended Governor and his said Successors shall on the first 
day of every term by themselves respectively or their sufficient 
Deputy present to the Court of King's Bench a Report ,↵ exhibiting 
in detail the whole state ↳, moral and medical of the establishment :↵ 
together with the economical state thereof ↳, at least in so far as 
the Public on behalf of the Prisoners is interested therein ↳: and 
moreover that they shall also by such deputy or if thereto ordered 
or required by the Court in person ,↵ then and there ↳, as well as on any 
other day or days on summons from the Court or in Vacation time

such questions as shall be put to them in relation thereto ↳, not only 
on the part of the Court or Officer of the Crown ,↵ but by leave

Art.22 .↵ And Whereas by a Report made to the Honour -↵ 
↳- able the House of Commons by a Committee of the said House ,↵ 
and dated the 22nd day of March ↳1 7 8 4↵ it appears that according 
to the first estimates made by Mess:rs Blackburn ↳& Hardwick 
Architects of the expence of erecting Penitentiary Houses fit for 
the reception of ↳9 0 0↵ Prisoners according to the plan prescribed 
by the Statute of the 19th of his Majesty Chapter ↳7 4↵ ,↵ the 
same would have amounted to the sum of £210,352 ,↵ making 
for the said hereby intended number of ↳1 0 0 0↵ prisoners the 
sum 
↳1 5↵ 
sum of £233,724,,8,,10 1/2 ↳; and according to the reduced estimate 
afterwards made by the said Architects would for the said 
number of ↳1 0 0 0↵ have amounted to £183,652,,4,,5 1/4 ,↵ exclusive of 
the expences of fitting up and stocking the said Establish -↵ 
↳- ment ↳; all which expences together ↳, considering the usual and 
almost unavoidable difference between estimated and actual ex -↵ 
↳- pence ,↵ could not reasonably be reckoned at less than £215,000 
in the whole ↳; insomuch that the said Jeremy Bentham ,↵ whenso -↵ 

↳- ever he shall have fulfilled the present agreement in relation 
said including 
to the intended establishment ↳, with the fitting up and stocking 
of the same ↳, may reasonably be computed to have saved to the pub -↵ 
the said 
↳- lic to the amount of at least £200,000 out of £215,000 in 
at the least 
respect of the same ↳. And Whereas the sum of £15,000 ↳, 
↳( being all that will remain of the said allowed sum of 
£27,000 after setting a part the sum of £12,000 for the 
maintenance of the said thousand Prisoners for one year )↵ 
is not by any means a sufficient allowance for the expence 
of building fitting up and stocking as aforesaid but only a par -↵ 
↳- tial allowance towards the same the bulk of the expenditure ne -↵ 
↳- cessary for the same being accordingly made up or to be made 
up by and out of the private fortune ↳, or saved by the ingenuity 
of the said Jeremy and the said Samuel Bentham or one of 
them And Whereas if such Buildings Improvements and 
Stock were not to be the property of the said intended Mana -↵ 
↳- gers the encouragement necessary to induce them to contri -↵ 
↳- bute by their own money to the improvement of the said 
Establishment would be in great measure wanting ↳, And 
Whereas on the other hand the fee simple of the said piece of 
ground will when purchased be according to the provision of the 
said Statute vested in some Feoffee appointed for that purpose 
by 
↳1 6↵ 
by the King's Majesty his Heirs or Successors ,↵ which Feoffee after the 
decease of the Survivor of the said Jeremy and Samuel Bentham 
under the powers of the said Act might if some provision were 
not herein and hereby made to the contrary take possession of the 
whole Establishment and so occupy or dispose of the same as 
to deprive the legal representatives of the said Jeremy and the 
said Samuel Bentham of all benefit from the said Buildings 
Improvements and Personal Estate ,↵ Now therefore it is hereby 
declared and agreed that upon the decease of the Survivor of the 
said Jeremy and the said Samuel Bentham if there shall be 
any person duly appointed by His Majesty as Feoffee to stand 
seized of the premises at and from the term of such decease then 
such Feoffee shall stand seized of the said real Estate and possessed 
of the said Stock and other personal Estate occupied with the same ,↵ 
in trust to permit the same to be occupied and enjoyed by the 
Devisee or Devisees of such Survivor as aforesaid and in default 
of such Devisee or Devisees then by the Executor or Executors 
Administrator or Administrators of ,↵ or person or persons intitled 
to take out Administration to ,↵ the personal Estate of such Survivor 
as aforesaid ,↵ untill due satisfaction shall have been made to the 
estate of such survivor as well for the value of the said Buildings

upon the said Land or any part thereof as for the moveable stock 
remaining thereon and occupied therewith :↵ And in default of 
such Feoffee so appointed ,↵ such seizin and possession as aforesaid 
shall remain and continue in such legal representatives or persons 
intitled to take out administration as aforesaid :↵ And all such 
allowances as under the terms of this agreement were made or 
to have been made to such Survivor ,↵ for or on account of the 
maintenance of the said Establishment ,↵ shall during the same

period continue to be made unto the person or persons so seized

full and peaceable possession of the piece of ground

Art.2 .↵ The said sum of £27,000 shall be paid 
at three several installments to wit £10,000 thereof

was required on the part of the said proposer for 
the purposes aforesaid was delivered in on or about 
the ↳1 7↵ of March which was in the year of our Lord

expence of which maintenance for the first year was included in 
the said estimate of £27,000 may by the cirumstances of the 
times be found to have undergone a considerable enhancement 
in consequence whereof the effective power of the said proposed 
partial allowance of £27,000 as of the said Proposer's private 
stock destined to have been added thereto is though nominally the 
same ,↵ become in effect so much the less and proportionably insufficient 
for the said intended purposes And Whereas in parti -↵

an enhancement by means of a duty thereon imposed by Parli -↵ 
↳- ament ,↵ to wit by an Act of the 20th of March ↳1 7 9 4↵ Ch.15 as also 
the price of Glass by an Act of the ↳1 7 9 4↵ Ch.37 And 
Whereas the delay from whence such encrease of charge hath accrued 
hath not happened through any default on the part of the said 
Proposer Now therefore it is hereby farther agreed that the said 
Jeremy Bentham and his Representatives shall at any time and 
so from time to time be at liberty to deliver in an account of all 
or any such articles expended either in quality of materials used 
in the construction of the said Building and its appurtenances

Art.18 .↵ The life of each Prisoner is to be insured by the 
said Jeremy Bentham and his Successors at the rate of £100 a 
head for a proportionable premium to be paid by the said 
Lords Commissioners and their Successors as follows .↵ A compu -↵ 
↳- tation shall be formed of the number of deaths that may be 
expected to take place among the Prisoners in the course of 
each year out of the said number of a thousand Prisoners 
living at the commencement of such year ↳, taking for the 
sum total of 
standard the annual proportion of the deaths at the end of 
a year to that of persons living at the commencement of the 
said year ,↵ according to the London Bills of Mortality ,↵ and 
↳' the calculations thereon grounded by the late Rev:d Dr Price .↵ 
Such computation being made ,↵ the said Jeremy Bentham ↳& 
his Successors shall at the end of each year be on the one 
hand be made Creditors to the amount of £100 for every death 
which in the course of the said year might according to such 
computation have been expected to take place among the said 
Prisoners ,↵ and on the other hand Debtors to the said amount 
of £100 for every death which within the said period shall 
actually have taken place .↵ As for example ,↵ suppose the number 
of deaths expected to have taken place at the end of the year 
to be to the number of persons living at the commencement 
of the said year as ↳1↵ to ↳2 5↵ ,↵ this for the said intended number 
of 
↳1 2↵ 
of ↳1 0 0 0↵ Prisoners will make ↳4 0↵ deaths :↵ £4000 then will be 
the sum which the said intended Governor will annually 
be made Creditor for upon the supposition of his receiving 
the said number of ↳1 0 0 0↵ Prisoners :↵ and as he will be made 
Debtor to the said amount of £100 for every one which du -↵ 
↳- ring the said period shall actually have died ,↵ it follows that 
if ↳4 0↵ ,↵ as expected ,↵ shall have died ,↵ neither more nor less ,↵ he 
will have nothing either to receive or to pay :↵ if ,↵ instead of 
↳4 0↵ ,↵ ↳4 1↵ ,↵ then he will have to pay to the amount of £100 ;↵ if 
instead of ↳4 0↵ ,↵ ↳3 9↵ ,↵ then he will have to receive to the said am -↵ 
↳- ount .↵ But £4000 for ↳1 0 0 0↵ Prisoners is the same proportion 
as £4 for ↳1↵ Prisoner :↵ it follows therefore that according to 
the above computation ,↵ £4 will be the premium for which such 
intended Governor will be to be made Creditor on account 
of any individual Prisoner on the day which delivered to his 
charge ,↵ on condition of his being made Debtor to the amount 
of £100 in the event of such Prisoner's dying in his custody 
within the compass of a year reckoning from the said day :↵ 
and so in proportion for any term less than a year 
Moreover in case of any dispute touching the amount of 
such premium or the payment of the said eventual head -↵ 
↳- money of £100 according to the rate of calculation herein 
above fixed ,↵ the same shall be settled by arbitration as above .↵ 
To secure to each Prisoner being able to work an 
honest and sufficient livelyhood at all times after the expira -↵ 
↳- tion of his term ,↵ it is moreover agreed that ,↵ on the dis -↵ 
↳- charge of every such Prisoner ↳, or at any subsequent 
period ,↵ the said intended Governor and his said Successors

may be retained by such Governor for payment of necessary 
cloathing furnished by him to the said Prisoner ,↵ untill the 
amount thereof not exceeding £3 shall have been discharged .↵ 
Art.20 .↵ To bind the attention of the said Jeremy 
Bentham and his said Successors the more forcibly to the 
reformatory part of the management of the said intended 
Penitentiary House and even make amends in most instances 
for any accident of its failure ,↵ it is moreover agreed that in 
the event of any such Prisoner's committing any felony after 
his discharge ,↵ there shall be paid by the said Jeremy 
Bentham or his said Successors ,↵ on the conviction of such 
Felon ,↵ a sum of money applicable to the indemnification of 
the party or parties damnified by such felony ,↵ encreasing 
according to the number of years during which such felon

Mess:rs Blackburn and Hardwick Architects of the expence 
of erecting Penitentiary Houses fit for the reception of ↳9 0 0↵ 
Prisoners according to the plan prescribed by the Statute 
of the 19th of his Majesty Chapter ↳7 4↵ ,↵ the same would 
have 
↳1 5↵

S d 
8,,10 1/2 ↳; and according to the reduced estimate afterwards made 

by the said Architects would for the said number of ↳1 0 0 0↵ have 
S d

fitting up and stocking the said Establishment ↳; all which 
expences together ↳, considering the usual and almost unavoi -↵ 
↳- dable difference between estimated and actual expence ↳, could 
not reasonably be reckoned at less than £215,000 in the 
whole ;↵ insomuch that the said Jeremy Bentham ,↵ whensoever 
he shall have fulfilled the present agreement in relation to 
the said intended Establishment ↳, including the fitting up 
and stocking of the same ,↵ may reasonably be computed to 
have saved to the public to the amount of £200,000 out of the 
said £215,000 at the least And Whereas the sum of £15,000 ↳( be -↵ 
↳- ing all that will remain of the said allowed sum of £27,000 after 
setting apart the sum of £12,000 for the maintenance of the said

↳- muel Bentham or one of them And Whereas if such Buildings 
Improvements and Stock were not to be the property of the 
said intended Managers the encouragement necessary to induce 
them to contribute by their own money to the improvement

wanting

the Surgeon £50 ↳: if no more than ↳3↵ ,↵ to the Master 
£50 ↳, to the Surgeon £25 :↵ and though the trade is a 
trade carried on on the account of individuals ,↵ the 
allowance is at the expence of Government .↵ 
The same principle has lately been applied by 
Administration of its own accord to the very case of 
Convicts for the purpose of ensuring good treatment 
to them during their voyage to the place of 
transportation .↵ 
The 
The date of Mr Bentham's Proposal of which the 
article in question forms a part ,↵ is considerably prior 
to the application made of it in both those instances .↵ 
Seeing it universally approved and applauded in these 
instances it would be matter of no small mortification 
to him to find it rejected in an instance in which at 
his own risk he has shewn so much anxiety to see it 
introduced .↵ Should the Inventor of this species of 
security be debarred the faculty of purchasing for 
valuable consideration a premium which so many 
others in similar situations are called upon to receive 
gratis ,↵ it would be a modern instance of the Sic vos 
non vobis ↳, and surely rather an extraordinary one .↵ 
Will it be seriously apprehended that under the 
influence of such a preservative Prisoners may not 
die fast enough in the Prison ↳? Should no mortal 
ever die there Government know the worst :↵ two or three

for immortality .↵

The Title proposed by Mr .↵ Bentham of 
Panopticon is in every respect obviously 
objectionable ↳_ The word in the Act of 
Parliament is ↳" penitentiary House ",↵ which had 
better be retained .↵ ↳_ 
Instead of having an Estimate made 
of the encreased prices of sundry Articles 
since March ↳1 7 9 3↵ ,↵ when the proposals by 
Mr .↵ Bentham were delivered ,↵ it will be better 
to fix the Sum at £30,000 ↳._ 

The words ↳" wholesome Food "↵ should be 
explained specifically ,↵ ↳& this may be done 
without injuring the principle ,↵ upon which 
Mr .↵ B .↵ intends to act ,↵ as he may enumerate 
a number of different sorts of food ,↵ and 
particularize those kinds ,↵ which he means to 
supply the persons under his Care with ,↵ 
provided any Alteration in their Diet 
becomes necessary for the purpose of inforcing 
amendment ↳& c ,↵ but to leave the matter 
entirely open under the general Words 
↳" Wholsome Food "↵ would be reposing too great 
a discretion in any Government ,↵ who is not 
only irremoveable ,↵ according to the Contract ,↵ 
but 
but whose Successor is so .↵ 
The Insurance as now proposed by Mr .↵ B .↵ 
would be infinitely too disadvantageous to the 
public ,↵ the Major part of those that die within 
the Bills of Mortality are within the Age of 
↳1 0↵ years ,↵ ↳& Mr .↵ B .↵ will scarcely have any 
person within that Age delivered to his Care ↳. 
The whole Article had better be omitted ,↵ or the 
Estimate made so as to exclude all persons 
under ten years old .↵ 
A Report is to be made by the Governor 
to the Court of King's Bench on the first day of 
every Term ,↵ ↳& the Court is to give such orders 
thereupon as shall be judged proper ,↵ but there

↳_ together with Mr Bentham's answer .↵ 
As this Article now stands ,↵ after the decease 
of Mr B .↵ ↳& his Successor ,↵ Government are to 
pay Mr B's Representatives for all the Buildings ,↵ 
Stock ,↵ ↳& c upon the premises ,↵ notwithstanding 
↳1 5↵ 
Government supply a large sum ,↵ viz :↵ £13,000 
towards such Building on the commencement of 
the undertaking ,↵ and eventually a much larger 
sum ,↵ by paying him ↳1 8↵ for every person 
committed to his care ,↵ above the stipulated number 
of ↳1 0 0 0↵ ,↵ for the express purpose of providing an 
habitation and enlarging his premises .↵ This ap -↵ 
↳- pears much too hard upon Government ,↵ and it 
would be fairer to let that matter be referred to 
Arbitrators ,↵ one to be chosen by Government ,↵ 
the other by Mr B's Representatives ,↵ with 
power for them to choose an Umpire in case 
of a variance in Opinion .↵ Such Arbitrators

behalf of Government out of the value of 
the Premises ↳& c in consideration of the said 
sum of £15,000 ↳, and the amount of the 
agregate sum the said payments of £18 may 
be estimated at .↵ 
Article ↳2 2↵ .↵ Had Mr Ford had any sufficient 
opportunity of being acquainted with the history of 
the treaty ,↵ Mr Bentham cannot but flatter himself 
that what appears now to him as a hardship 
upon Government would have appeared to him in a 
different light .↵ A proposition that seems to be 
tacitly assumed is ,↵ that the money in question 
is so much clear money out of the pocket of 
Government on account of Mr Bentham's plan ,↵ 
over and above what it would have paid otherwise :↵ 
Whereas ↳( except as to an article of £6000 of which 
presently )↵ Government is at no expence at all 
upon 
↳7↵ 
upon it .↵ In the mean time having been repeatedly 
called upon to ↳" make his arrangements "↵ he had accord -↵ 
↳- ingly laid out thousands ,↵ upon the faith of the 
original agreement as above stated .↵ 
It is now two years since every thing was agreed 
upon ,↵ every thing in black and white ,↵ ready for signa -↵ 
↳- ture ,↵ had the consent of the Land-owners been forth -↵ 
↳- coming .↵ During all this time the benefit of General 
Bentham's mechanical inventions ,↵ diverted at Mr Ben -↵ 
↳- tham's instance from what would otherwise have been 
their application to this ↳( of doing the work by the 
labour of Convicts instead of the more advantageous 
mode by steam )↵ has been lost :↵ one seventh of the 
term of his patent has been consumed :↵ workmen ,↵ 
collected with great difficulty ,↵ have been kept in waiting 
↳( without a possibility of making any thing saleable 
of their work )↵ at a great expence .↵ No idea has 
been ever entertained of making Mr Bentham 
any sort of satisfaction for these losses .↵ Such are 
the circumstances under which Mr Ford ↳( surely for 
want of being sufficiently apprised of these )↵ proposes 
that Mr Bentham's Representatives should be 
loaded with a new charge to the amount of £15,000 .↵ 
As to arbitration ,↵ it is what Mr Bentham pro -↵ 
↳- posed in regard to other points ,↵ and could have very 
little apprehension from in regard to this ,↵ supposing 
the 
↳8↵ 
Panopticon 
the above facts to be established .↵ But for this 
purpose he does not very well see how ,↵ in justice 
to his Representatives ,↵ he could avoid calling upon 
the persons in question to admit them or deny them 
↳( a troublesome and unpleasant business on both sides )↵ 
nor would it be a pleasant situation for him to 
have to leave his Representatives with a burthen 
of such a weight hanging over their heads .↵ 
Mr Ford will easily conceive ↳, that the Building ,↵ 
though a considerable part ↳, is nothing nigh the 
whole of the expence at coming in .↵ Fitting up ↳& 
furnishing ,↵ especially the apartments of the Officers ,↵ 
Clerks ,↵ ↳& c ,↵ who will be very numerous ,↵ stocking the 
Manufactories and the Hospital ,↵ Cloathing ↳( an article 
which must come heavy at first before there are 
old cloaths to serve for working )↵ All this ,↵ besides 
a new invented system of machinery ↳, which ,↵ though 
not half compleated for such a number ,↵ has already 
cost several thousand pounds .↵ So far therefore from 
having been understood that the £15,000 was all of it 
for the building ↳, it is not true ,↵ nor any thing like 
true ↳. Mr Campbel's charge ,↵ as appears from the 
Reports of the House of Commons ,↵ was at the 
rate of £30,000 instead of the £27,000 and that 
for several years together .↵ 
↳3↵ 
upon the occasion ,↵ it only gives Mr Bentham 
for his Penitentiary Plan ,↵ and that for a single 
year in one case ,↵ and for two years in another ,↵ 
what it is now giving to Mr Campbell ,↵ and 
would continue to be giving to him otherwise ,↵ for 
his Hulk Plan .↵ 
Mr Ford assumes ,↵ as it was very natural for him 
to do ,↵ that of the £27,000 ,↵ £15,000 was for the 
Building ,↵ since £15,000 is the difference between the 
£27,000 ↳( the sum demanded for the first year ↳/ and 
£12,000 ↳( the sum demanded for every subsequent year 
for the ↳1 0 0 0↵ Prisoners ↳/: and an inference equally natural 
was ↳, that ,↵ as Government had paid that sum once 
for the Building to Mr Bentham ,↵ it should not 
have to pay that sum over again to his Represen -↵ 
↳- tatives .↵ But no such line of distinction was ever 
drawn on either side till now .↵ Mr Bentham's pro -↵ 
↳- position was ↳_ ↳" Land with a fixed price to it has 
been appropriated to the purpose of a Penitentiary 
↳" House ↳_ You give Mr Campbell £27,000 for every 
↳" year for maintaining Prisoners on the Hulk Plan _↵ 
↳" Give me that sum for the first year only ,↵ I will 
↳" buy the Land ,↵ I will find Buildings ,↵ ↳& c .↵ and for every 
↳" year I will maintain the same number for £12,000 .↵ 
↳" Here then you have the Penitentiary Plan for the 
↳" first year at no more than the expence of the 
Hulk 
↳4↵ 
↳" Hulk Plan ,↵ and for every other year and for little more 
↳" than half that expence ."↵ This was the proposition 
acceded to :↵ not a syllable ,↵ so much as hinted ,↵ about 
refunding any part of the money :↵ Mr Bentham's 
having the Land in Fee Simple was incompatible 
with it .↵ Afterwards it appeared that before the 
Proposal had been given in ,↵ the expence of the 
Hulk Plan had been reduced to £21,000 :↵ but the 
demand of the £27,000 having been made and acceded 
to ,↵ the reduction made no difference with regard 
to Mr Bentham's treaty ,↵ nor was any notice 
ever taken of it .↵ Had the Hulk price been 
what the only documents then public shewed it 
to be ,↵ Government would have got an annuity of 
£9000 a year for nothing :↵ to say nothing of the 
many other advantages to the public ,↵ most of them 
attended with correspondent burthens to Mr Ben -↵ 
↳- tham .↵ As it was ,↵ they had £6000 to pay for this 
annuity of £9000 .↵ ↳( £6000 being the difference 
betwixt the £27,000 and the £21,000 .)↵ Such is 
the hardship to Government .↵ Suppose the Annuity 
to be postponed for two years instead of one ,↵ then 
the bargain is still more advantageous to Government ,↵ 
than if it had obtained gratis an annuity to the 
same amount ,↵ but of that retarded commencement .↵ 
It was on this latter basis that Mr Bentham 
grounded 
↳5↵ 
grounded his recent Proposal for the lodging of 
Supernumeraries .↵ ↳" Give me for only two years what 
↳" you are now giving to Mr Campbel ,↵ viz :↵ ↳2 1↵ a 
↳" man ,↵ for every subsequent year I will maintain 
↳" them forever after at my own price of ↳1 2↵ ."↵ 
What then will it cost Government ,↵ even for these 
two years ,↵ to give them to Mr Bentham rather 
than Mr Campbel ?↵ Not a penny .↵ For every 
year after the two years ,↵ the saving here too is ↳9↵ .↵ 
Here then is an annuity of ↳9↵ for every Convict obtain -↵ 
↳- ed by Government for nothing .↵ Such is the hard -↵ 
↳- ship to Government upon this score .↵ What would 
Government have had to pay ,↵ if it had gone to work 
and built a Penitentiary House for these supernume -↵ 
↳- raries upon the common plan ?↵ A second Penitent -↵ 
↳- iary House could not be built for half a dozen or a 
dozen supernumeraries as they happen to be brought 
in :↵ and upon the common plans not a single super -↵ 
↳- numerary could be taken in to the first house .↵ 
The second must be built for the greatest probable 
number ,↵ say ↳1 0 0 0↵ .↵ With the benefit of Mr Black -↵ 
↳- burne's frugality a Penitentiary House for a thousand 
could not be had for so little as 200,000 .↵ It might 
now be had ↳( say )↵ for 100,000 .↵ But for one reason 
or other ↳( such as diminution in the number of 
Criminals ,↵ improvement of the County Prisons ,↵

↳"& c ↳& c "↵ 
Article ↳1↵ .↵ Already acceded to at the first word ,↵ 
and for the reasons given by Mr Ford .↵ 
Article ↳2↵ .↵ Mr Bentham would be very glad 
to be rid ,↵ even at some hazard ,↵ of the delays and 
difficulties attending the making of an exact esti -↵ 
↳- mate .↵ From such view as he has been able to 
obtain of the matter ,↵ he cannot consent willingly 
to accept of so little as the £30,000 .↵ He would 
be satisfied with a thousand more .↵ The two first 
installments would then stand £12,000 amd £12,000 ,↵ 
instead of £10,000 and £10,000 :↵ the last instalment 
payable on the reception of the Prisoners to re -↵ 
↳- main as it is at £7000 .↵ This £4000 being 
in satisfaction for the extra expences relative to 
the Building cannot in any part of it be post -↵ 
↳- poned to the other period .↵ 
Article ↳7↵ .↵ As to what concerns the specification 
in regard to wholesome food ,↵ Mr Bentham will 
do his endeavours to meet Mr Ford's ideas 
without 
↳2↵ 
without further discussion ,↵ sensible to the obliging 
attention he has shewn not to insist on conditions 
injurious to the principle .↵ 
In this view he proposes the article to stand 
thus -↵ 
Article.7 .↵ Each Prisoner shall be supplied every 
day with wholesome food :↵ viz :↵ bread ,↵ interchangeable 
with rice ,↵ pease ,↵ potatoes ,↵ or other roots commonly 
used for human food ,↵ or with messes made of oat -↵

human food ,↵ as much as he shall choose to eat ;↵ 
together with a competent allowance of meat ,↵ or 
fish ,↵ or soups ,↵ or other messes made of any such 
animals and parts of animals as are usually em -↵ 
↳- ployed for human food :↵ which said allowance of 
meat or the equivalent thereof as aforesaid shall 
also be made in like manner without stint to every 
man who shall be employed in work ,↵ and who 
shall exert himself with ordinary diligence in the 
execution of the same :↵ but in case of idleness or 
misbehaviour the quantity of such meat or succe -↵ 
↳- daneum to meat is expressly reserved as well as 
↳( the same being wholesome )↵ 
the quality to the choice of the said Jeremy Ben -↵ 
↳- tham and his Successors as a means of engaging 
the said Prisoners without the spur of corporal 
severities to set their hands to labour .↵ N.B .↵ There is 
no specification at all with regard to food in any of the Hulk Contracts .↵ 
Article p .↵ 
↳3↵ 
Article ↳1 8↵ .↵ Mr Bentham submits to Mr 
Ford's Proposal in regard to the excluding out of 
the Estimate all ages under ten years :↵ but he flatters 
himself Mr Ford will not think it unreasonable 
that the exclusion should be suspended for the first 
year ,↵ considering the dangers to health that threaten 
an institution of this sort at its outset ,↵ when per -↵

multitudes at once from all the Jails in the King -↵

the best professional advice seconded by the strictest 
attention may be no adequate defense .↵

Plymouth out of about ↳7 0 0↵ there died in one year 
between 1/6 and 1/5 of the whole number ,↵ as appears

In conclusion ,↵ my Lord ,↵ I am inclined to think Your 
Lordship will find the following charges ,↵ against the Duke 
of Portland ,↵ but too well established .↵ ↳_ 
↳1↵ .↵ That he has not only assumed ,↵ but concurred in the 
exercise of ,↵ a dispensing power ,↵ by advancing positions tending 
to warrant him in defeating ↳_ and defeating accordingly ↳_ the 
the sole object of the Act of ↳1 7 9 4↵ ,↵ by which a Penitentiary estab -↵

has been guilty of an illegal exercise of legislative power ,↵ a -↵ 
↳- mounting in its effects to the repeal of an imperative law 
of Parliament .↵ 
has 
↳2↵ .↵ The he assumed and exercised the power of punish -↵ 
↳- ing Convicts ,↵ by a mode of punishment of his own choice ,↵ 
in cases in which that mode of punishment was ,↵ by Par -↵ 
↳- liament ,↵ expressly forbidden to be employed :↵ and ,↵ in so doing ,↵ 
has been guilty of another illegal exercise of legislative power ,↵ 
amounting in its effects to the enactment of a positive impera -↵ 
↳- tive law ,↵ as well as to the repeal of a prohibitive law .↵ ↳_ 
↳3↵ .↵ That ,↵ in another instance ,↵ he has assumed at any 
rate ↳( whether in any and what degree he may have exercised 
it ,↵ being matter of enquiry )↵ a dispensing power ,↵ viz :↵ that of 
defeating one of the declared objects of another Act ↳_ the Act 
of ↳1 7 7 9↵ ↳_ in so far as the confinement of Convicts of a certain 
description on board the Hulks ,↵ is among the modes of pu -↵ 
↳- nishment ,↵ the choice of which is therein committed to the 
respective Courts :↵ and ,↵ in so doing ,↵ has been guilty of another 
illegal exercise of legislative power ,↵ amounting in its effects to 
the repeal of a corresponding portion of another imperative law .↵ ↳_

↳2↵ 
Dispensing Power 
↳4↵ .↵ That at any rate on the part of his Under Secretary ,↵ 
Mr King ,↵ by whom the letter ,↵ containing the manifestation of 
these several illegal pretensions was drawn up ,↵ the offence 
was_not in any degree the result of a bona fide miscon -↵ 
↳- ception or inadvertence ↳_ but ,↵ wilful ,↵ deliberate ,↵ and obstinate :↵ ↳_ 
the repugnance ,↵ between the intentions ,↵ as declared in such 
letter ,↵ and the will of Parliament ,↵ as declared in the Acts ,↵ 
on which those intentions were pretended to be grounded_being 
a circumstance ,↵ of which ,↵ from the first to the last ,↵ he Mr 
King was fully conscious :↵ and that this criminal conscious -↵ 
↳- ness is ,↵ prima facie at least ,↵ to be imputed to the Duke ↳_ the 
Principal Secretary ↳_ by whom the letter was signed ;↵ in as 
much as ,↵ in that letter ,↵ he declares in express terms that he 
has ↳" examined "↵ the said Acts ↳_ and that he ↳" understands the 
↳" object of "↵ them .↵ ↳_ 
That besides these offences against the authority of 
Parliament ↳_ by concurring with the Commissioners of the 
Treasury and their Secretaries in giving to the party con -↵ 
↳- tracting with the Treasury ,↵ by a letter written after many 
months deliberation and conference ,↵ an authority for making 
preparations for an establishment of double the magnitude ,↵ 
and consequently double the expence ,↵ of that which ,↵ by the ac -↵ 
↳- ceptance of the original proposal ,↵ they stood engaged to give ;↵ ↳_ 
↳_ such authority being given in the express view ,↵ of making 
use of such necessary enhancement of expence ,↵ as a pretence 
for the utter ↳" relinquishment "↵ of the whole concern ;↵ ↳_ the said

pretence accordingly made use of as a ground and reason

addressed to Parliament ,↵ and precluding on his part the 
possibility of a reply :↵ ↳_ that this proceeding being an act of 
systematical fraud and treachery and oppression ↳_ altogether 
repugnant to the principles of natural justice and good faith ↳_ 
is ↳_ of itself ↳( and independently of other similar acts committed

of partial ,↵ ill calculated ,↵ false expediency :↵ as all supposed 
expediency is ,↵ that is aimed at ,↵ or even compassed ,↵ at the 
expence of that superior expediency ,↵ which follows with or 
without being looked for ↳_ in the train of justice .↵ ↳_ 
According to this false rule ,↵ such arrangements should 
have been taken ,↵ as should have had for their object the 
effectual prevention of the return of every individual Convict 
that had ever been consigned to that scene of intended annihi -↵ 
↳- lation :↵ and that as well at all times from and after the 
expiration of his legal terms of punishment ,↵ as before it ._↵

man ?↵ Then what becomes of the Mother Country and its security ?↵ 
A well behaved man ?↵ then what becomes of the economy of 
the settlement ,↵ and the only chance it has of contributing any 
thing ,↵ in some distant Century ,↵ to the object of Reformation ?↵ ↳_ 
These being the two plans_grounded on the two rival 
principles ↳_ one of them alone consistent with justice and ulti -↵ 
↳- mate utility ↳_ each consistent with its own principle ↳_ which 
was the plan actually pursued ?↵ The answer has been

been forced upon incapable minds by experience ↳_ the unjust

think :↵ and the moment they did begin to think ,↵ their 
thoughts were bent upon injustice ._↵

N .↵ S .↵ Wales 
of local distance ↳- had been trusted to ↳- nature herself having 
been thus perverted into an instrument of iniquity ↳- a tool 
of dispensing power .↵ The mask was now thrown off and the 
Monster presented itself in undisguised deformity .↵ I mean that face 
of it which was seen where the power was felt ↳- in New South Wales :↵ 
for the face seen in this Country was never completely unmatted 
till now .↵ Not only had this most obvious precaution been neglected ,↵ 
but at this time ,↵ no instructions whatever for the Governor ,↵ in any 
such view as that of preventing the return of Convicts ↳- at least 
of de jure emancipated Convicts ↳- had been received .↵ For at this 
very time ↳( as we learn from the paragraph next before the 
above )↵ such as should be desirous of returning to England were 
↳" informed ,↵ that no obstacle would be shown in their way "↵ ↳( the 
way of those Convicts whose sentences of transportation had expired+ 
↳" they being at liberty to ship themselves on board of such vessels 
↳" as would give them a passage ".↵ ↳- Such was the communication ,↵ 
↳- such the language ,↵ which justice would naturally dictate to 
honourable minds ;↵ unfettered as yet and uncorrupted ,↵ by instruct

Office ,↵ and directed either to the Governor ,↵ or to the Judge Advocate _↵ 
↳( for to whom else could they have been directed ?)↵ Papers thus

↳( ↳) Collins p .↵ ↳7 4↵ July ↳1 7 8 9↵ .↵ Notwithstanding that little more than 
↳" two years had elapsed since our departure from England ,↵ several convicts 
↳" about this time signified about this time that the respective terms for

↳" left by the Masters of the transports with their owners in England ,↵ instead 
↳" of being brought out and deposited in the colony ;↵ and as ,↵ thus situated ,↵ 
↳" it was equally impossible to admit or to deny the truth of their assertions ,↵ 
↳" they were told to wait until account could be received from England ;↵ ↳& 
↳" in the mean time ,↵ by continuing to labour for the public ,↵ they would 
↳" be entitled to share the public provisions in the store .↵ This was by no means 
↳" satisfactory ,↵ as it appeared that they expected an assurance from the governor 
of receiving some gratuity for employing their future time and labour for the 
↳" benefit of the settlement .]↵ One of these people having ,↵ in the presence of his

This general modification ,↵ by which the condition of 
Expirees was for the first time brought upon the carpet being 
explained ,↵ I proceed to collect the manifestations that occurr 
of the conduct observed by the local government in relation to it .↵ 
In this little piece of history ,↵ it will be necessary to 
distinguish two periods :↵ the one preceding the point of time at 
which the first intimation of the intentions of Administration 
here at home in relation to the liberty in question appears ↳( as far 
as the information extends )↵ to have been received :↵ the other sub -↵ 
↳- sequent to it .↵ 
I .↵ Conduct 
↳( ↳) 
In the anecdote ,↵ besides the main point ,↵ we see another ex -↵ 
↳- emplification of the spirit of injustice with which the whole system 
is impregnated .↵ It was not enough to stretch into a perpetual 
punishment a punishment of which there remained but two 
years fourteen or seven years ↳- the same extension was here 
given to a punishment of which there remained but two 
years .↵ An account of a set of extensions more or less nume -↵ 
↳- rous ,↵ in the same strain ,↵ but some of them ↳( I understand )↵ 
barbarous in the degree ,↵ will be among the account which Your 
have 
Lordship's Most Noble predecessor will one day perhaps to give .↵ In 
some recent instances ,↵ Convicts whose confinement in New South 
Wales would have become illegal almost as soon as it would 
have commenced ,↵ were liberated at the indication of a person very 
near to me ,↵ from the oppression to which they had been doomed 
under the auspice of his Grace :↵ and I had the satisfaction 
to learn that it was to Your Lordship's justice ,↵ that he is 
indebted for the few items struck out of the catalogue of his 
res gestae ,↵ in a relation to this his ↳" improved Colony ."↵ 
↳1 2↵ 
I .↵ Conduct of the Governor towards Expirees ,↵ principally in relation 
to their liberty of departure ,↵ before the month of August ↳1 7 9 2↵ :↵ being 
the time at which the intelligence was received ,↵ of the Instructions 
subjecting it to his will and pleasure .↵ 
No .↵ ↳1↵ ↳( p .↵ ↳7 4↵ )↵ July ↳1 7 8 9↵ .↵ The situation in which Expirees in 
general now found themselves placed has been already stated .↵ 
By one individual in particular ,↵ an experimental proof of the 
nature of the situation was at this same time received .↵ The 
only evidence by which the Governor's right to confine any body 
in New South Wales could be established not being forth -↵ 
↳- coming ,↵ a man in whose instance there was no doubt but 
that his time of punishment was expired ,↵ claimed his liberty .↵ 
For the course of his argument ,↵ having used some words which 
though not mentioned were deemed ↳" disrespectful to the 
↳" Lieutenant Governor ",↵ he was punished with six hundred lashes ,↵ 
and kept in irons for six months .↵ A very instructive example 
certainly :↵ it showed more what was to be got by talking about rights .↵ 
No .↵ ↳2↵ ↳( p .↵ ↳1 3 0↵ )↵ August ↳1 7 9 0↵ .↵ Another freeman trying to quit the 
Colony punished ↳" for taking a very improper mode ".↵ The act itself 
consisted in the exercise of that liberty which the law of the land 
had saved to him ,↵ and which no man alive had any right so 
much as to pretend to give him leave to exercise .↵ The impropriety 
of the mode consisted in the not asking leave ,↵ at the risk of 
receiving six hundred lashes and wearing irons for six months .↵ 
Mode of punishment of course flogging though not mentioned :↵ 
number of lashes not mentioned .↵ This freeman ↳" was punished to -↵ 
↳-" gether with a Convict "↵ ↳( bondsman )↵ who had made a like attempt 
in the same ship at the same time .↵ As far as can be judged ,↵ 
right or no right made no sort of difference .↵ 
No .↵ ↳3↵ .↵ 
↳1 7↵ 
N .↵ S .↵ Wales 
According to the account given by Captain Collins in the 
same paragraph ,↵ at the very time of giving this assurance ,↵ the 
intention was that it should not be fulfilled .↵ For now it was 
that ↳" it was understood "↵ ↳( now for the first time ,↵ as already observed )↵ 
↳" that a clause was to be inserted in all future contracts for 
↳" shipping for this country ,↵ subjecting the masters to certain 
↳" penalties ,↵ on certificates being received of their having brought 
↳" away any Convicts or other persons from the settlement without 
↳" the Governor's permission :↵ and as it was not probable that many 
↳" of them would ,↵ on their return ,↵ refrain from the vices ,↵ or avoid 
↳" the society ,↵ of those companions who had been the causes of their 
↳" transportation to this country ,↵ not many could hope to obtain the 
↳" sanction of the governor for their return ".↵ ↳_ A promise was thus 
given to all ↳- and this at the very time when it was understood _↵ 
understood ,↵ not by those who received it ,↵ but only by those who 
gave it ,↵ that ↳" not many "↵ would ever receive the benefit of it .↵ ↳_ 
No wonder :↵ since in the bosom of the Governor there was this 
are 
dilemma for every one :↵ ↳_ you a bad man ↳? ↳_ you would do mis -↵ 
↳- chief elsewhere :↵ are you a good man ?↵ ↳_ we can't spare you .↵ It 
was by this last horn of the syllogism ,↵ that Bloodsworth was 
hung up ↳_ the good Convict mentioned in No..3 .↵ ↳" As his loss 
↳" would be severely felt should he quit it "↵ ↳( the Colony )"↵ while in 
hi ↳" its infancy "↵ therefore it was that he received what is 
called his freedom ↳_ viz :↵ an obligation to work for two years ,↵ 
having for his recompence the not being starved .↵ ↳_ 
To say nothing of the perfidy ↳_ the wanton useless perfidy ↳_ 
there is in this business a sort of inconsistency which to me 
is most perfectly inexplicable .↵ If guided by his own untutored ↳& 
uncorrupted sense of justice ,↵ the Governor had set out with this 
exhilerating 
↳1 8↵ 
exhilerating assurance ,↵ and afterwards ,↵ by instruction from his 
superiors ,↵ have found himself compelled to revoke it ,↵ and had 
revoked it accordingly ,↵ the case would have been intelligible e -↵ 
↳- nough .↵ But here no such assurance is given until the very 
time when ,↵ spontaneously or under instructions ,↵ a resolution is 
taken not to fulfill it .↵ 
N .↵ ↳1 0↵ ↳( p .↵ ↳2 6 8↵ )↵ Feb ↳1 7 9 3↵ .↵ At this time the expectation about 
↳" the clause ↳... in the chapter party "↵ for preventing Shipmasters from 

↳" receiving any person "↵ whatever on board ↳" from the Colony ,↵ without 
↳" the express consent and order of the Governor "↵ was found to be 
l 
realized .↵ The Bel ona ,↵ arrived 15th January ↳1 7 9 3↵ came provided 
with this clause .↵ She had sailed from England on the 8th of 
August ↳1 7 9 2↵ .↵ The ↳" improved "↵ Colony was thus improved into 
a pretty compleat Bastile :↵ a key only being put into the 
hand of the Governor with liberty to let loose any person whom 
he might be induced to favour .↵ Into the jaws of this Bastile 
came out by this same vessel several free and honest families .↵ 
They had been inveigled hither by conditions held out by govern -↵ 
↳- ment .↵ These conditions are stated by Captain Collins ↳( p .↵ ↳2 6 7↵ .)↵ 
Among these conditions I do not observe that of being dependent 
for their return on the arbitrary will and pleasure of a suc -↵ 
↳- cession of unknown Governors ,↵ the instruments of an arbitrary 
and perfidious Minister and his successors .-↵ 
N .↵ ↳1 1↵ ↳( p .↵ ↳2 6 8↵ )↵ 19th February ↳1 7 9 2↵ .↵ The sincerity of the assurance 
given in the preceding August ,↵ as mentioned in N .↵ ↳9↵ ,↵ began 
now to manifest itself .↵ On this day sailed for Canton this 
same ship the Bellona .↵ Into this ship had been received six 
persons from the settlement :↵ two of them expirees ,↵ by permission :↵ 
two other Expirees also ,↵ but without permission :↵ as likewise 
two 
↳7 5↵ 
N .↵ S .↵ Wales 
two non-expirees .↵ These four fugitives were discovered by smoking 
the ship ,↵ an operation ,↵ for which the consent of the master ↳( for 
so it is particularly stated )↵ had been obtained .↵ Of the non-expi -↵ 
↳- rees it is stated that they had not yet served the full period 
but 
of their sentences .↵ From this statement it seemed reasonable to 
inferr that even these ,↵ had they returned to England ,↵ would not 
have been landed there till after the day at which they had 
a right to land on British ground .↵ Be this as it may ,↵ 
thus much is our doubt ,↵ that by this order the assurance 
given in the preceding one of August ↳1 7 9 2↵ was compleatly 
violated :↵ and that in respect of the faculty of leaving the 
Colony ,↵ the condition of those who had a right ,↵ and those 
who had not a right ,↵ was the same :↵ the same under the 
eye ,↵ and by the act of that very Governor ,↵ by whom the exist -↵ 
↳- ence of the right had not seven months before ,↵ been noticed 
and recognized so that ,↵ by his own shewing ,↵ he kept them 
there in defiance of the law .↵ 
N .↵ ↳1 2↵ ↳( p .↵ ↳2 8 3↵ )↵ 24th April ↳1 7 9 3↵ .↵ A second opportunity for ma -↵ 
↳- nifesting the sincerity of the assurance ,↵ and the manifestation is 
of the same kind .↵ ↳" But few Convicts "↵ ↳( meaning Expirees ,↵ says 
Captain Collins )↵ ↳" were allowed to quit the Colony in these ships :↵ 
by which it is evident that it was want of permission on the 
part of the governor ,↵ and not want of room or any other 
faculty that prevented the numbers from being greater .↵ The 
ships were two .↵ On another occasion in Nov .↵ ↳1 7 9 4↵ it appears 
that the number of Convicts received on board two ships only 
↳( the Endeavour and the Fancy )↵ had been near an hundred + :↵ 
whereof fifty by permission ,↵ fifty more without it.+

The French tyrants if they had no justification had at least 
self preservation for an excuse .↵ The Englishman ,↵ who I suppose

as the shadow of an excuse ?↵ 
The French nation ,↵ and the whole civilized world in 
sympathy with it ,↵ cried shame upon the monster with five 
heads !↵ What will it now say of the single head ,↵ that orga -↵ 
↳- nized this tenfold tyranny ?↵ ↳_ 
Such is the crime a sample at least of the crimes ↳_ 
of William Pitt .↵ His successors ,↵ not daring to be innocent 
where he is guilty ,↵ choose rather to be accomplices than 
avengers ,↵ or so much as disapprovers of his misdeeds .↵ And 
this conspiracy of present power with ill-earned influence for 
of 
the distruction law and justice ↳_ this audacity ↳_ the offspring 
of pusillammity covers itself with the mask of respect and 
gratitude .↵ ↳_ 
But would you then have had these living nuisances 
turned loose again to prey upon the community ↳_ upon a 
community from which they had so justly and so necessarily 
been expelled ?↵ ↳_ Corrupted ,↵ as you yourself alledge ↳_ corrupted 
as they have been by the very discipline which should 
have reformed them ↳_ would you have the Country receive 
a second time all poison into her bosom ?↵ ↳_ After all 
this outcry about illegality ,↵ and perfidy and oppression ↳- is 
thenis then after all the real aim and practical conclusion 
at the bottom of it ?↵ ↳_ 
My Lord the difficulty cannot stand more fully 
expressed in any eye than it does in mine .↵ To mine ,↵ it is 
indeed 
↳3 2↵ 
confinement any where in England two things require here 
to be observed ↳- 1st That it would be no more than the 
fulfillment of promises already made :↵ 2nd That being but 
being a compliance with the respective laws it is no more 
than what used to take place under the do transportation 
system -↵ no more than would have taken place had 
there never been any such Colony as New South Wales .↵ 
Notwithstanding this ,↵ there is ,↵ it must be confessed ,↵ in the 
idea of such influx of something that can scarce fail 
terror 
to strike a sort of horror into every breast that thinks of it .↵ 
This terror ,↵ so far as it is inspired by reason

present Majesty relative to the building of Penitentiary Houses

of transportable and other Crimes .↵ ↳_ 
I understand the objects of those Acts to be ,↵ that such 
Penitentiary Houses should be used principally as receptacles 
for such transportable Convicts ,↵ as the several gaols of the 
respective Counties cannot contain ,↵ from the time of their receiving 
sentence ,↵ till an opportunity may offer for their being trans -↵

With respect to the probably number of transportable Convicts ,↵ 
no safer rule can be adopted ,↵ than by taking the greatest num -↵

the increase yet th of live stock ↳& will probably more than 
counterbalance the difference ↳.....] ↳] ↳( d )↵ 

As to other Convicts ,↵ it will depend on the opinion of 
the Judges who try them ,↵ what number of them it may be 
proper to confine in the Panopticon :↵ it is impossible to ascer -↵ 
↳- tain with accuracy the number to which they may amount :↵ 
but I incline to think it would be very inexpedient to move 
such Persons from the country Gaols ,↵ unless the crowded state 
of those Gaols should render it absolutely necessary :↵ for it

increase has had one or more of three objects :_↵ pre -↵ 
↳- vention of disease ↳_ affording working room ↳_ affording 
means of separation for Convicts of different descriptions :↵ 
sequestration in various degrees of perfection ,↵ up to 
the pinnacle of penal luxury ↳_ total solitude .↵ ↳_ 
Space for prevention of disease is a most indis -↵ 
↳- putable improvement ,↵ wherever necessary ,↵ but an 
improvement that has no particular reference to 
penitentiary discipline .↵ Of this salutary discipline ,↵ 
space for separation ,↵ space for working ,↵ may be 
stated as to the two characteristic features ,↵ so 
far as architecture is concerned .↵ ↳_ 
In the increase of space for separation ,↵ 
reformation ,↵ or rather non_increase ofor corruption ,↵ 
was the object aimed at .↵ This object will have 
been compassed in a greater or less degree of per -↵ 
↳- fection according to the sufficiency of the architec -↵ 
↳- tural means ,↵ and the use made of them in the 
management .↵ As far as my opportunities of ob -↵ 
↳- servation extended ↳_ and the enquiry was once 
an object to me ↳_ one great obstacle to this end 
appears to apply in common ,↵ and with scarce 
any exception that I could observe ,↵ to all these 
prisons :↵ I mean the want of compleatness in 
the plan of separation .↵ What matters it whether 
there be certain times of the day in which the 
raw are debarred from getting instruction from 
the reprobate ,↵ if there are others in which they are 
brought together ?↵ In the department of wholesome 
instruction 
↳1 0↵ 
Letter 3d 
instruction ,↵ is a school the less a school because 
the body boys are not always in the school room ?↵ 
Separation however ,↵ even though carried to 
the length of solitude ,↵ is not of itself sufficient 
for reformation .↵ To reformation ,↵ occupation is 
necessary :↵ occupation ,↵ profitable or at least innocent ,↵ 
to fill up the mind with useful ideas or at 
least innocent ones ,↵ and by that repletion to 
exclude mischievous ones .↵ ↳_ 
Inclosed space ,↵ for whatever purpose ,↵ is not 
to be had without expence .↵ To pay for that 
expence if work be proposed to be done ,↵ it is 
necessary not only that work shall be done ,↵ but 
done in such quantity and such quality ,↵ as to 
equal the expence .↵ It is in this way that the 
interests of reformation and those of economy 
are intimately blended and connected .↵ Work of 
some sort or other ,↵ profitable or not profitable in 
point of economy ,↵ is necessary for reformation .↵ But 
the less the expence of reformation ,↵ the less it will 
be grudged .↵ 
Grudged ↳? ↳_ says a voice somewh somewhere ↳_ 
whether your Lordship's or whose else I am unable 
to distinguishs out of all habits as I am with 
great men ↳_ Grudged !↵ however ↳( says the voice and 
in a tone of displeasure ↳_) and what of that ↳? ↳_ as 
if where reformation is at stake expence would be 
grudged by any body :↵ as if in such a case the 
grudgery of the money ,↵ if it were grudged ,↵ ought to 
stop the issue of it !↵ For corruption ,↵ no my Lord :↵

and Penitentiary Houses upon do are so identical 
in principle ,↵ that ↳( even without adverting to the 
vicinity between the first and the second floors of 
the same edifice )↵ a man may without much 
apprehension of error venture to state them as 
coming out of the same shop .↵ ↳_ 
Up Upon the principles I have thus ventured 
to point to in the improved prisons in question ,↵ 
present or future ,↵ one drawback from the goodness 
of the economy ↳_ one great drawback and than an 
unavoidable one ↳_ is the smallness of the scale .↵ 
Another is the shortness of the term which ,↵ in those 
receptacles for petty offenders ,↵ the improved hands 
have to learn the business in ,↵ and afford a 
compensation ,↵ for the time and materials consumed 
without profit ,↵ during the season of primaeval 
awkwardness .↵ ↳_ 
Under these disadvantages ,↵ together with that 
which results from the difference between the 
wages of labour ,↵ as compared with the expence of 
maintenance ,↵ here and in America ,↵ I should not

expect to find it within the compass of human

to bring the improved English prisons in question 
upon a level in point of economy with that of 
Philadelphia .↵ It is not without surprize that 
in some instances within my reach Dorsetshire 
in particular ↳( Oxfordshire I have but an indistinct 
recollection of )↵ I have observed in how meritorious 
↳( c )↵ 
a degree these obstacles have been overcome .↵ 
In these home instances the grand misfortune 
is ,↵ that in regard to the main object ↳_ the object 
with reference to which example and reformation 
themselves are but as means to an end ↳_ I mean 
the decreased of crimes ↳_ circumstances do not 
admit of their affording any such satisfactory proofs 
of efficacy as in the more favourable situation of 
the Philadelphia prison may be and have been 
afforded :↵ ↳_ why ?↵ ↳_ because the good effects of the 
discipline of these good jails are to such a degree 
drowned in the bad effects of the surrounding bad 
ones .↵ ↳ In Pensylvanyia too ↳& in New York ,↵ the whole 
system of penal justice is invigorated by the abolition 
of capital punishment as above :↵ while in England 
the debility resulting from the opposite excess ↳( by 
debility I mean the relaxation that pervades the

compensated in any ascertainable degree by the

little more than five months after viz :↵ on the 25th of 
March ↳1 8 0 0↵ ,↵ the Treasury ,↵ on the ground of a preparatory 
Letter therein spoken of as received from his Grace ,↵ write 
to me to acquaint me that the ↳" proposed building of 
↳" a Panopticon was to be calculated to accommodate ↳2 0 0 0↵ 
↳" persons ".↵ This ,↵ by way of answer to an humble address 
of mine ,↵ written of on the 17th of August more than seven 
months before ,↵ in the declared view of my making 
preparations of an expensive nature ,↵ and begging to know 
for what number they were to be made .↵ Faithful to 
this same plan while I was amusing myself with 
these preparations ,↵ together with other occupations 
which the same policy had provided for me ,↵ the

neither his Grace's nor your Lordship's pleasure ,↵ has ever 
yet ,↵ I believe ,↵ been directly signified .↵ 
For proof I betake myself once more to the 
worthy Magistrate :↵ in whose testimony ,↵ as far as it goes ,↵ 
let it point what way it will ,↵ I really have great 
confidence .↵ In his title page ,↵ as well as in his survey 
the New Prison is comprized :↵ I mean the so called 
New Prison ,↵ the old and beggarly neighbour of the vastly 
new as well as costly and courtly structure half prison 
half pl palace ,↵ in Cold Bath Fields :↵ What he says of it is 
as follows ↳_ 
No .↵ ↳1↵ .↵ Page ↳4 1↵ .↵ ↳" Few places of confinement can be under 
↳" worse regulation than the New Prison ↳.... The arrange -↵ 
↳- ment of the prison itself is such ,↵ as renders it impossible 
↳" to prevent its being one of the most dreadful seminaries 
↳" of vice and profligacy that can be imagined ."↵

↳-" dequate without great inconvenience ,↵ to the additional 
↳" expenditure of £4000 .↵ But may we not hope ,↵ if

↳ In this respect ,↵ at the worst not as bad as the Hulks :↵ nor yet a great

suspect ,↵ without being able to affirm it to a certainty ,↵ that the worst 
and the best are together there at sometimes though not at all times .↵

↳" I verily believe ,↵ to expend from the public purse 
↳" four thousand pounds in any way more beineficial 
↳" to the community than that which is here pointed out ".↵ ↳ 
Thus far the worthy Magistrate .↵ ↳- A supposition ,↵ 
unquestionably though tacitly assumed in the hypothe -↵ 
↳- tical offer thus made by him ,↵ is ↳_ that on the other 
part some regard would be paid to the ruler of 
common honesty ;↵ that the County would not be made 
bankrupt to him ,↵ as Parliament has been made 
to me :↵ and that after his proposal had been 
accepted ,↵ his capital with the concurrence of the 
acceptors as advanced upon the faith of it ,↵ and Acts 
of Parliament ,↵ if necessary ,↵ obtained for it ,↵ he would 
not have to see the execution of it set down in petto 
for the Greek calends ,↵ by any such person as the 
predecessor of the ↳" great person "↵ he is so afraid of 
flattering ↳_ not to speak of successors .↵ ↳_ To the 
not add to the County rates the worthy Magistrate's own imagination 
↳( Your Lordship may venture to assure him )↵ is the likeliest place for 
finding what he wants .↵ Years ago he would restrain vice ↳& improve 
morals without adding to County rates would have made his appear -↵ 
↳- ance had there been any such person in existence .↵ An Acct of 
Parliament for doing all this ↳_ an establishment which in 
the opinion of Parliament would do all this ↳_ would restrain 
vice and improve morals without adding to the County rates ↳_ 
has by Parliament been ordered to be set up for above these 
↳8↵ years .↵ Whatever be the thing needful join will to power 
and the thing is done .↵ Power for this there has been all this 
time beyond dispute in a certain place :-↵ Duty there has 
always been :↵ full knowledge of that duty there has always 
been :↵ ↳_ had will been in the same place the thing would have 
been done years ago ,↵ ↳& neither the worthy Magistrate nor so 
many other people would have been left at this time of day 
to amuse themselves with ↳" hopes "↵ and ↳" expectations ".↵ ↳_ 
↳ Here the worthy Magistrate is quite mistaken .↵ ↳" I can 
tell 
↳4 2↵ 
Your Lordship with the balm of tranquillity to pour 
into his ear .-↵ Cold Bath Fields Prison ↳( Your Lordship 
may be pleased to observe to him )↵ is up already :↵ 
it is up high in favour :↵ and ↳- what is beyond 
every thing ,↵ and without which every thing else would 
be as nothing ↳- there is no Gospel ↳- propagating Lord -↵ 
no friend of the ↳" great person's "↵ to steal up the back 
staircase and whisper in his ear ↳- up or not up 
the spot is too near me ↳_ it must not be made 
use of ._↵ 
Let him come forward then with his offer .↵ 
↳(_ I mean the worthy Magistrate _)↵ It is a yet but 
a hypothetical one :↵ ↳- let him convert it into a cate -↵ 
↳- gorical one :↵ accepted or not by the County ,↵ he has 
nothing to fear from great persons ,↵ so long as he 
can keep himself from ↳" flattery ".↵ ↳_ As to the £400 
a Year Your Lordship and he together will be able 
to find a use for it :↵ ↳_ it will sever with in a 
trifle for a place of Inspector of Prisons ;↵ to smell 
at the same nosegay with the Inspector of Hulks 
who will come on the carpet presently :↵ ↳- it will 
serve for otuim cum dignitate to the declared 
protege of the worthy Magistrates ,↵ I mean the so 
well protected Governor :↵ a personage who ,↵ if he does 
not do much good to a prison by governing it ,↵ 
might at any rate not do much harm to it 
by inspecting it at a distance ._↵ 
Another scrape indeed ,↵ it must be confessed ,↵ 
my Lord ,↵ and ,↵ at first blush blush at least ,↵ a still 
more serious one ,↵ is that which the worthy Magistrate 
seems 
↳4 3↵ 
seems to have fallen into ,↵ by asking for Jail building 
money from Parliament ,↵ to ease his County from 
so much Poor-rate .↵ It was but t'other day as Your 
Lordship has been seeing that Acts of Parliament were 
broke through by great persons to shake the burthen 
off from government ↳& throw them upon the Counties .↵ 
Great persons giving themselves this trouble lay the 
burthen on the Counties :↵ and already he calls upon 
them to undo their own undoings ,↵ ↳& get Parliament 
to take it off the Counties !↵ The Counties did I 
say ?↵ I beg his pardon ↳_ not all the Counties toge -↵ 
↳- ther ↳& by a general Act ,↵ but one County only ↳& 
that the richest in the kingdom ,↵ ↳& by a particu -↵ 
↳- lar Act ↳_ by a priviligium which he wishes to see 
made on purpose !↵ ↳_ A more unfortunately-timed 
pretension ,↵ to all appearance at least ,↵ surely was 
never brought forward ,↵ than this which has been 
thus insinuated by a gentleman who ,↵ I dare answer 
for him ,↵ meant nothing less than to offend times 
↳& reasons .↵ ↳_ Ah !↵ why did I not see that fatal page 
before it made its escape out of the press !↵ No human 
being is insignificant ,↵ but that accident may throw 
in his way the means of service .↵ ↳_ 
On this untoward occasion ,↵ what is there that 
can be done for a gentleman ,↵ who in the midst of 
his anxieties to steer clear of the rock of offence ,↵ 
has thus run full upon it ?↵ ↳_ Step in once more ,↵ 
my Lord ,↵ to his relief ,↵ for nothing less than a great 
person can effect it .↵ The seals of the fountain of 
mercy are in Your Lordship's hands ↳_ grudge not a 
few 
↳5 5↵ 
presumption in regard to will ↳_ the clearest proof 
of a disposition at least ,↵ not to grudge exertions 
toward the application of a remedy ,↵ howsoever that 
disposition might be overruled by other circumstances .↵ 
From the mere circumstance of a man's having 
given information of a mischief ,↵ the conclusion is 
certainly far enough from being a necessary one ,↵ that 
whether obtainable or not obtainable ,↵ he would him -↵ 
↳- self be a fit person to be employed in the appli -↵ 
↳- cation of a remedy .↵ A person so circumstanced is 
however the first person the idea of whom would 
naturally present itself in that view ,↵ supposing him 
not set aside by other specific considerations .↵ I mean 
always in the eye of any official person ,↵ to whom 
the cure of the mischief was either the sole object or 
so much as the primary object in view .↵ To a mind 
comtemplating the subject in any such point of view 
a man ,↵ in whose instance such prima facie 
evidence of fitness had manifested itself ,↵ would natu -↵ 
↳- rally present himself as standing first upon the 
list of candidates .↵ 
Principles standing thus ,↵ now as to facts .↵ Of 
two persons competent in the highest degree to do the 
business ↳_ men above all exception ↳_ willing to do the 
business ,↵ in at least one instance ↳( for they had done 
it in one instance )↵ indication had been given by 
experience .↵ Inspectors spontaneous ,↵ zealous ,↵ gratuitous ;↵ 
two for this one office .↵ The place being to be made 
was it offered to either of these gentlemen ?↵ ↳_ was 
it offered to Sir Henry Mildmay ?↵ ↳_ was it offered 
to 
↳5 6↵ 
to Mr Neild ?↵ The negative is but too nor notorious .↵ 
If in one of the two instances situation in life was 
such as to exclude hope of acceptance ,↵ that could b 
not be the case in the other .↵ 
Thirty years ago the indefatigable ↳& gratuitous 
Agent of the Charity for the relief of debtors ,↵ travelled 
the first of circuits three years before even Howard 
had begun his .↵ I called Neild a second Howard :↵ 
with more propriety I called Howard a second Neild .↵ 
Howard sunk under a jail fever ,↵ Neild has survived 
one .↵ The exertrions of Howard have long since received 
their quietus from above :↵ Neilds seem but to in -↵ 
↳- crease with age .↵ Two such circuits in one year 
adorn the annals of ↳1 8 0 2↵ .↵ This Honourable Colleague 
↳_ a Member of the legislature and not an idle one ↳_ 
a man standing already in full light ↳_ would derive 
nothing like illustration from a hand like mine .↵ 
In a station like Your Lordships there have 
been men that would have knelt to both these 
gentlemen rather than not have gained one of them 
for the office .↵ In the instance of Mr Neild at 
any rate ,↵ whether he would or would not have 
accepted of the office would not be known ,↵ to a 
certainty at least ,↵ without asking :↵ accordingly he 
was not asked .↵ The experiment would have been 
too dangerous :↵ it was a case not to be trifled with .↵ 
Seeing how he had been occupying himself ,↵ and what 
he lived for ,↵ would any prudent man have an 
swered for his non-acceptance ?↵ Yeer Year after 
year his active beneficence had embraced and covered 
the

That recommendation by subordinates should 
be taken without enquiry is natural enough ,↵ customary 
enough ,↵ certainly not illegal ;↵ and so far without 
dispute not culpable .↵ In the present instance ,↵ for 
judging of the propriety of the recommendation ,↵ or 
of the views which gave it birth ,↵ two points may 
afford some light :↵ the one antecedent to the ap -↵ 
↳- pointment ;↵ the other subsequent :↵ the person 
recommended for the office ,↵ ↳& his conduct when 
invested with it .↵ 
The gentleman who comes out of the pocket is 
without dispute the friend of the wearer of the pocket 
out of which he comes .↵ ↳- What are his other titles ?↵ 
To me ,↵ who neither am known nor know ,↵ he is known 
by nothing but a name :↵ nor even by name shall 
he be spoken of by me .↵ In matters of this kind ↳- 
where public money is thus disposed of ↳- in my 
estimate at least which never looks for any thing 
more than human in the bulk of men ↳- not the 
receiver ,↵ but the donor -↵ I had almost used another 
word ↳- is to blame .↵ What is on record -↵ what is pub -↵ 
↳- lic ↳- may be mentioned without reserve :↵ ↳& it is 
quite sufficient for the purpose .↵ Lord Pelham ,↵ on 
coming into office ,↵ finds him a Police Magistrate ,↵ 
at £400 a year .↵ By one of Lord Pelham's two exertions ,↵ 
to this £400 is added another £100 ,↵ God knows why 
or wherefore :↵ and for decency's sake ,↵ and because 
it could not be done otherwise ↳- the whole corps of 
the Police-Magistrates I mean ↳- for as to drudges who 
must attend ,↵ and must understand the business ,↵ 
the 
↳6 1↵ 
two acts are there .↵ Two Acts both of them to provide 
for one gentleman ,↵ a gentleman already provided for 
in a situation always besigged besieged by candidates :↵ 
an Act to increase his recompense ,↵ the other to 
reduce his service .↵ 
But ,↵ Sir ,↵ what ground for all this ?↵ Is there 
to be no end of all this malice ↳_ of all these impu -↵ 
↳- tations ↳_ these uncandid these envenomed insinuations ?↵ 
My Lord ,↵ my answer is as distinct as possible .↵ 
Four features ↳_ four antecedent features ↳_ betray ,↵ even of 
themselves the complexion of the business .↵ 
First the existence of such an abuse ↳_ and for 
such a length of time ↳_ year after year ↳_ under the 
very noses ↳_ ↳( the term is a coarse one ↳_ under the 
eyes I should have said ,↵ had gentlemen chosen to 
have eyes ↳_) of such a pyramid of official personages 
as those whose duty it was to prevent it .↵ 
Secondly ,↵ the neglect ↳_ a neglect too indecorous 
to have been manifested without cogent reasons ↳_ the 
compleat neglect shown to the only persons by whom 
the smallest wish to see it remedied had ever been 
manifested .↵ 
Thirdly ,↵ the total absence of all signs of dis -↵ 
↳- pleasure ↳_ as well rewards the persons by whose im -↵ 
↳- mediate misconduct the mischief had been brought 
about ,↵ as towards the perpetually silent and mo -↵ 
↳- tionless official spectators ,↵ by whose connivance it 
had been fostered :↵ ↳_ or the contrary ↳_ 
Fourthly ,↵ the positive tokens of satisfaction given ,↵ 
by resorting to these very patrons ↳& protectors of the 
abuse 
↳6 2↵ 
abuse ,↵ for the recommendation of the persons by whom 
the semblance of a remedy was to be applied .↵ The 
gentleman whose duty it had been ↳_ first under the 
Duke of Portland ,↵ then under Your Lordship ↳_ to have 
prevented the abuse ↳_ ↳( I speak of the individual abuse 
↳_ the barbarity ↳& consequent mortality )↵ to have pre -↵ 
↳- vented it by drying it up in its source ↳_ I mean 
the whole system of Hulk confinement ↳_ the gentleman 
who to avoid preventing it sed set aside two Acts of 
Parliament ,↵ by the Letter which the Duke was ill -↵ 
advised enough to give auspices and signature ↳_ this 
gentleman ,↵ instead of preventing the abuse ,↵ re nurses 
it :↵ ↳_ he nurses it for months ↳& years :↵ he nurses 
the mortality for a year and a quarter ,↵ and I 
know not how much longer ;↵ ↳_ he nurses the source 
of it ,↵ under Your Lordship to this day .↵ He nurses 
the abuse itself till it is ripe ↳_ ripe on the verge 
of universal rottenness ↳_ ripe by the rotting of the 
victims at a rate at which by this time they would 
have been more than half killed off ↳_ he keeps 
nursing it to this pitch of critical rp ripeness ↳_ 
by 
when lo !↵ by a misadventure ,↵ converted into his 
ingenuity into a lucky hit ,↵ an occasion turns up 
for reconne recommending a friend to look at it :↵ 
↳_ to look at it ,↵ and ,↵ on pretence of correcting it ,↵ to 
keeps it uncorrected .↵ ↳_ 
Thus ,↵ in an inferior hot-bed ,↵ an immature 
felon ↳( I have heard it said )↵ is nursed till he is 
but 
become ripe :↵ a felon worth £10 ,↵ till he is worth 
£40 .↵ Those are pretty profits ,↵ fit for petty hands .↵ 
£350 
↳6 3↵ 
£350 a year ,↵ a douceur for a gentleman ↳_ for the friend 
of the gentleman who does every thing ↳_ was not to be 
made up so easily :↵ a hecatomb ,↵ and more than a 
hecatomb ,↵ of victims was to be sacrificed ,↵ before an 
offering could be raind worthy of the chosen priest ,↵ 
who was to stretch his hands over the altar ,↵ and 
make as if he were putting a period to the sacrifice .↵ 
In this place ,↵ truth compells me to ac -↵ 
↳- knowlegdge ,↵ proof that would be termed legal fails 
me :↵ rumour ↳_ notoriety ↳_ whatsoever be the word ↳_ 
is in several points the only ground I can exhi -↵ 
↳- bit even so much as in the way of reference .↵ 
I have no eye-witness to depose ,↵ that as often as 
a Noble Secretary hias appeared to act ,↵ a gentleman 
on the other side the wainscoat has pulled the wirer ↳. 
Friendship between the gentleman who popp'd out 
the 
of his pocket ,↵ and the gentlemen out of whose 
pocket the other popped ,↵ is a point not less diffi -↵ 
↳- cult to prove ,↵ at least by the evidence of sense .↵ 
The Nobel Lord and the gentleman on the other 
side of the wainscoat could ,↵ either of them ,↵ by their 
evidence put both points out of doubt .↵ Fortunately 
or unfortunately the favourite ma maxim about 
self-crimination and self-depredation ,↵ the maxim 
made to cow cowe cover this and every thing else 
that oughr ought to be disclosed ,↵ steps in ↳& covers 
them :↵ so that on this occasion ,↵ as on all others ,↵ 
they may do exactly as they please .↵ On these obscure 
and delicate points ,↵ circumstantial evidence then 
is the sole resort :↵ ↳& before the bar of the public at 
least 
↳6 4↵ 
least ↳_ not to speak of other bars ↳_ circumstantial 
evidence is not altogether without its weight .↵ As to 
one point then ,↵ does not the same wire which at 
one time pulled the hand of a Nobl Noble Duke ,↵ 
continue to pull the hand of his Noble successor ,↵ ↳& 
always in the same oblique and tortuous line ↳_ 
The crowding plan ↳_ the plan so distinctly chalked out 
by the epistle from the Upper-floor to the under ↳_ 
is it not pursued still without deviation ,↵ pursued 
in full view of the effect of it ,↵ by those who to 
pursue it ,↵ ↳& pursue it with full effect ,↵ have 
nothing to do but to do nothing ?↵ ↳- Then again as to 
the fair side ↳_ the amiable ↳_ the friendly side of the 
business ↳_ I beg leave to ask ↳_ unless for a friend ,↵ a 
very particular friend indeed ,↵ is it in the nature 
of man thus ↳_ thus compleatly ↳_ to expose himself ↳? 
I say to expose himself :↵ but to shew how compleat 
the exposure is ↳_ ↳& that on both sides ↳_ subsequent 
events will require to be called in ↳_ subsequent events 
which I now proceed to submitt to a pair of Noble 
eyes on which they will make the same impression 
as all preceding ones .↵ Yes ,↵ my Lord ,↵ subsequent facts ,↵ 
facts notorious and in direct proof ↳_ will manifest 
themselves ↳, and in doing so will point backwards ,↵ 
↳& throw day light upon motives .↵ 
Theory has been spoken of ↳_ now comes experi -↵ 
↳- ence :↵ ↳- duty has been spoken of ↳_ now comes perform -↵ 
↳- ance .↵ Even upon the face of the law ,↵ the duty is 
meagre and gap/ inefficient :↵ and performance falls 
short even if the meagre scantling so carefully chalked

Report of an address to the Throne ,↵ approving of the Preliminaries of 
Peace with the Republic of France ↳_ 
↳. ↳. ↳. A detailed ↳& most masterly exposition of these is to be found 
in Mr Pitt's speech of the ↳3↵ Feby ↳1 8 0 0↵ ,↵ in which among other particulars ,↵ 
an account is given of his proceedings toward the people and govern -↵ 
↳- ments of the several states of Milan ,↵ Modena ,↵ Genoa ,↵ Tuscany ,↵ the 
Pope ,↵ Venice ,↵ ↳& Egypt .↵ Of all these things it may be said generally ,↵ ↳& as 
it should seem without exception ,↵ ↳_ such was purposely the profusion of 
engagements ,↵ ↳& such the uniform and systematic breach of them ,↵ ↳_ that 
not a single act was done ,↵ which was not in violation of some engage -↵ 
↳- ment ,↵ ↳& certainly not a single engagement contracted ,↵ or profession made ,↵ 
that was not ,↵ in every part of it ,↵ grossly and in most cases instantly violated .↵ 
The french rulers ,↵ have ,↵ throughout ,↵ evidently acted upon the principle ,↵ 
that he who could divest himself at once of all moral feeling ,↵ and 
release himself from all moral controull controul ,↵ must for the time 
have an immense advantage over those who should remain under the 
old constraints ,↵ and who might not be sensible immediately of the change 
which had taken place ,↵ or ,↵ when they were ,↵ might be long incapable either 
of adopting it into their own conduct ,↵ or of so unseating their antient feelings 
and habits ↳( the habit for instance of relying in some degree on men's 
apearances ,↵ yielding something to their professions ,↵ believing in part what they 
should solemnly assert ),↵ as to make themselves proof against its effects .↵ 
Nobody has entered more fully into their views ,↵ or pursued them logically

The detail of this would then ,↵ that mere change of time and place made no 
change in the character of the person ,↵ or of the system pursued .↵ It appears by all ,↵ 
that good faith passed for small nothing :↵ that deceptions the most gross ,↵ 
artifices unheard of in diplomatic proceedings ,↵ even practiced without 
shame or scruple .↵ When a party was once engaged in a negotiation ,↵ ↳& 
placed in a said situation in which he could no longer help himself ,↵ 
it was in vain to expect that any regard would be paid to the professions 
in which the negotiation began ,↵ or to declarations which occurred in the course 
of it .↵ Any old engagement was set aside ,↵ or any new one foisted in ,↵ as suited 
the wishes ,↵ original or incidental ,↵ which France happened to entertain .↵ 
H .↵ p .↵ xlvi 
Such is the deplorable laxness of mankind ,↵ such the abject hommage 
which men are willing to pay to crimes attended with success ,↵ to wickedness 
united with power ,↵ that none of the acts committed at any time by the 
agents of the French government ,↵ seem at all to have hurt their reception 
in the world ,↵ either collectively or individually .↵ Their oppressions ↳& cruelties excite 
no indignation ;↵ their low and scandalous frauds no contempt ;↵ their treacheries
